0,Prof Sophia Ananiadou,https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/sophia.ananiadou.html,"
Research interestsProf. Ananiadou's main contributions are in the area of text mining and natural language processing. She is director of The National Centre for Text Mining (NaCTeM) the first publicly funded centre of its type in the world. She played a leading role in the creation of the centre,  negotiating  strategic links with industry (e.g. Pacific Life, Unitis, Pfizer, AZ, Unilever, Atypon, Microsoft, IBM, Elsevier and Nature) which has helped to guide NaCTeM towards its current status of a fully sustainable centre that engages with both academia and industry.
Her research covers a diverse range of areas, including terminology, information extraction, document classification and clustering, sentiment analysis, query expansion and resource building. These have been applied in a number of domains, such as biology, medicine, health and social sciences.
Her research has resulted in my publication of over 350 peer-reviewed publications in journals and conferences. My H-Index stands at 51 (Google Scholar) with over 10,000 citations, placing her in the top 30 most cited scholars worldwide in text mining.
Important research outcomes have included the following:
Computational terminology led to the development of the C-value method for automatic term recognition, which has been adopted as a standard for automatic term extraction internationally.  C-value has been packaged into the widely-used TerMine service.Work on acronym recognition has led to the development of the popular Acromine service.Work on direct and indirect association mining resulted in the deeopment of the FACTA+ service for which I was interviewed by New ScientistA major outcome of the AHRC Big Data project Mining the History of Medicine is the History of Medicine search engine, which provides semantically-enhanced search over the archives of the British Medical Journal (1840-present day) and the London-area Medical Officer of Health reports (1848-1972). This work featured in the Lancet.Collaboration with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) supported the development of a widely used tool, RobotAnalyst supporting search and screening of systematic reviews based on novel machine learning and text mining methods. RobotAnalyst is currently used by NICE, Cochrane teams and over 40 research institutes worldwide.Leading role in the development of interoperable text mining platforms to support research in several areas: the U-Compare and Argo platforms received funding from IBM, EU, BBSRC, AHRC, JISC and DARPA. Leading role in the interoperable platform funded by H2020 OpenMinTed.Role in making the University of Manchester a Hub in the UK of the META-NET Network of Excellence,  forging the Multilingual Europe TechnologyClosely involved with teams of psychology and mental health to provide text analytics for mental health onset prediction.At Salford Royal,  involved with the Lung Studies team on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), extracting phenotypic information from literature and integrating knowledge from electronic health records and the literature.
In 2010, she supervised NaCTeM in the critical assessment of information extraction in biology (BioCreAtIvE III) protein-protein interaction (PPI) challenge to achieve the best performance, in what was considered the most challenging task, the Interaction Method Task (IMT). 
In 2013, she supervised  NaCTeM in BioCreAtIvE IV. NaCTeM achieved the best results in the tasks related with the automatic recognition of chemicals and genes (Comparative Toxicogenomics Database) and Chemical and Drug Named Entity Recognition.
NaCTeM’s event extraction system, EventMine, outperformed other systems in the BioNLP 2011 and 2013 tasks (pathway curation and infectious diseases, epigenetics) in the complex task of event extraction.
In 2015, within the DARPA funded Big Cancer Mechanism project,  her team produced the top performing ‘federated system’ for reading, producing the best performing text mining solutions for extracting entities and events for cancer pathways.
A co-instigator of the launch of a Special Interest Group within ACL (SIGBioMed) in 2008, dedicated to language processing in the biological, biomedical, and clinical domain bringing together researchers in NLP, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and computational biology, providing a venue for the promotion and dissemination of original research in this area. The BioNLP workshops are hubs of evaluation of text mining technology in biomedicine via the creation of shared tasks for which she acted as co-organiser.

Research interestsDr Tim Morris researches real-time video processing problems, texture measurement and image segmentation issues. Video processing research finds applications in creating intelligent assistants - such as non-contact computer interfaces based on speech or image input - and in video-mediated communication. Research into image segmentation is being demonstrated by the interpretation of medical images. His postgraduate students have worked on different aspects of perceptual interfaces (using head orientation and gestures as communication channels); on video coding and coded data quality assessment; on interpretation of medical imagery; and on video-telephony.
He is currently involved in two research areas:
 
Retinal Image Processing
The retina is affected by many illnesses; we are looking at glaucoma, diabetes and macular degeneration. We are interested in diagnosing glaucoma and monitoring its progress in an objective fashion since it has been shown that the variability amongst optometrists is of the same magnitude as the changes associated with glaucoma. Similarly, we are attempting to separate patients known to be diabetic into groups with lower and higher risk of losing vision or developing other complications.
A side issue in this research is to investigate methods of quantifying texture.
 
 
Assistive Technology
Visually handicapped people have different needs in using home and office equipment or in navigating unknown areas. We are investigating two problems:
How can a visually handicapped person determine their location without the benefit of visual cues? Again, handheld devices are being investigated in the solution.How can a visually handicapped person navigate through the envoronment in a safe fashion? Can we develop devices that are easier/more reliable than a white cane?
In both cases the handheld device (probably a smartphone) will capture images, process them to determine the appropriate information, and deliver audio output.

His research interests include automatic terminology extraction, classification and management, compound word recognition and digital corpora encoding. He also investigates terminology-driven mining of scientific literature (in particular for life sciences) by extracting terms and establishing associations and links among them. He is interested in text analytics and sentiment analysis from online resources, in particular in the healthcare domain.  He leads the UK healthcare text analytics network (http://www.healtex.org) and his team is  part of The Farr Institute’s Health eResearch Centre (HeRC), where he co-ordinates healthcare text analytics efforts in collaboration with a number of local hospitals and charities.
His current research focus is on large-scale extraction and linking of clinical/epidemiological findings from electronic health records (EHRs), healthcare social media and biomedical literature. His team has worked on mining narratives from EHRs (e.g. for clinical outcomes in cancer patients, or medication prescription extraction), making sense of patient-generated data from social media (e.g. benefits and harms of medical treatments) and providing context to clinical decision support systems (e.g. for treatment planning in brain injuries). He has led a number of joint projects with healthcare service providers (e.g. semi-automated large-scale anonymisation of clinical narratives; identification of mental health symptoms in social media; process mapping of occupational therapy reports), as well as with industrial partners (e.g. dynamic clinical documentation management, information extraction from clinical trial reports).

I am particularly interested in the fabrication and analysis of magnetic nano structures, which have a wide variety of applications from data storage to biomedical. 
Key areas of my research include:
Analysis of readout methods for magnetic, optical and magneto-optical data storage.Simulation and modeling of readout mechanisms in novel data storage systems.Characterisation of magnetic materials using Magneto-optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) and Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE).Channel and data recovery techniques for data storage systems.Lithographic techniques for patterning media for storage applications.
I have built a number of instruments for the MOKE analysis of magnetic materials and develop other techniques, such as AHE, which offer improved sensitivity.
I also like to engage in projects outside my chosen field of research. For example I have run three KTP projects with local SMEs developing automotive diagnostic test systems, BACnet enabled control products, and improving hard disc recovery rates.
I have recently secured research funding (in excess of £1M). One project is investigating the emission of THz pulses of radiation for spintronic sources, working jointly with the Department of Physics and Astronomy. The other is a follow-up KTP award with a local SME, Titan Products, to develop wireless sensors and systems for the HVAC industry, working with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

Description Logics are a family of knowledge representation formalisms with several nice properties such as high expressive power, well-defined semantics, decidable inference problems, and practicable inference algorithms for these problems. I work on Description Logics as the logical underpinning of ontology languages such as OWL and OWL 2; their usage, for example, in molecular biology; practical inference algorithms for highly expressive Description Logics; and on the complexity of and inference algorithms for Description, Modal, and Dynamic Logics, using e.g., automata-based and tableau-based techniques.

Research interests My research is concerned with the mathematical foundations of computer science, or, if you will, it is the area between mathematics and computer science. I am interested in modelling logics and (programming) languages, and mathematical structures that arise as such models. I am a member of the School of Computer Science, and I also have connections with the School of Mathematics. I work most closely with other members of the Mathematical Foundations Group. My recent publications are concerned with various categorical models of linear logic, and with games. The former makes connections between mathematical entities called morphisms and proofs, and these in turn can sometimes be connected with programs, or algorithms. Ultimately we would like to have a mathematical understanding of computer programs in the way that we have a mathematical understanding of the various phenomena that physics talks about. On a more concrete level I have given specific models of progams and proofs using certain kinds of games which are known as graph games. All my work is theoretical, and so typical results consist of proofs that there is a correspondence between certain entities that exist in the mathematical model and proofs or programs.

Research interestsMy research has followed a theme of the computer science associated with managing and using complex information in inter-disciplinary settings, from early research into presenting complex information in audio to blind people, through research into tools for data analysis in e-Science to my principle research area in biomedical semantics.
Within my biomedical ontology research I have led the ontology building and use within the school as one vertex of a virtuous triangle of ontology language fundamentals, tool development and ontology development and use. I have published the first papers on semantic similarity using bio-ontologies, the use of bio-ontologies to query multiple distributed information sources, to discover new proteins through classification, and to publish discovery of new biological facts in a high impact biology journal from the use of Semantic Web technologies.
This research into semantically describing and managing biomedical data has had a counterpart in my activity within e-Science research. I led the user activity of the Taverna Workflow Workbench (led by Carole Goble) in analysis of biomedical data. I was first author on the first paper to mention workflow within bioinformatics; the lead author on the first paper to use workflows to demonstrate an automation of biological analysis and a supervisor (with Andy Brass) of Paul Fisher, who developed novel methods for analyzing gene expression data that has led to insights into tolerance to trypanosomiasis in East African cattle.

Research interestsCurrent research is focussed on developing novel perpendicular anisotropy, nanostructured exchange spring thin films for data storage (e.g. for bit patterned media) and spintronics. A particular interest is the interaction of hybrid magnetic films where individual layers with in-plane and perpendicular anisotropy (PMA) are placed in intimate contact. The competition between exchange coupling, magnetostatic interactions and anisotropy provides a rich playground to explore zero applied field spintronic devices such as spin torque oscillators (STOs) and controlled topological magnetic structures including mutual domain imprints and vortices.
We have a significant effort in creating and understanding the properties of magnetic thin film multilayers where, in addition to the applied field, the system exhibits atemperature dependence. A prototype structure is FePt(high PMA)/FeRh/FePt(low PMA) where the magnetic properties are controlled by the FeRh layer which uniquely undergoes an antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition above room temperature (T~ 370K). This material shows considerable promise for heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) and very recently it has been suggested that it might also form the basis of a memory resistor.
A second stand of research concentrates on electrical measurements of magnetic properties where we pattern mesoscale Hall devices to study the switching of nanomagnetic objects including novel, high ansiotropy PMA materials and to measure the transport properties of FeRh.
Additional research work is focussed on understanding magnetism in graphene and exploring the potential of 2D materials for spintronic applications.

Research interestsI am interested in nanomagnetic materials and devices for data storage and processing. Much of my research has been in materials and data storage processes for hard disk drives. Hard disks have increased in capacity exponentially for 50 years enabling them to remain central to computer technology and be key components in the creation of common devices such as TV set top boxes that enable viewers to pause and rewind live TV.
The hard disk industry now faces severe challenges in continuing its past performance growth, and radically different systems including magnetic solid-state devices (spintronics) are being developed and coming into use.
I work mainly on micromagnetic modelling of thin magnetic films and nanomagnetic devices, on fabrication of novel materials, and on experimental characterisation of their storage capabilities.
Current projects include modelling of conventional storage media for use in Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) and Bit Patterned Media (BPM) in which nanotechnology is used to create nanometre scale magnetic islands, each of which acts as a repository for a single bit of information. I am also interested in Spin Torque effects for Magnetic RAM (MRAM) and for high frequency oscillators. The fabrication challenges for such materials and devices are immense but may be essential to the continued improvement in data storage technology.
I work in collaboration with many academic and industrial research groups in the UK, Europe and the rest of the world.

As is widely known in HCI and explored in Participatory Design research, the dissemination of computing systems in most strata of society puts designers in a position of power against systems’ users - i.e. citizens. This has lately become more apparent due to the substantial implications of these systems in shaping the ways through which we make decisions, we produce, consume and exchange, and the ways through which we understand and participate in politics. Any system can be described as an abstract representation of its inputs and outputs. The ways through which data is being represented, stored and governed, and the processing logic of the system for transforming and negotiating the data that receives and produces. Taking a Digital Civics approach on systems design, my research raises questions about the provenance of technological innovations, the socio-political effects of the research and artefacts that we produce, our research and systems’ data management and ownership processes and the ways through which multiple passive or active agents negotiate and transform such data. My current research attempts to shed light onto such inquiries by following a commons-based approach for the creation of systems to promote open and participatory production and governance processes.  The approach through which I work to achieve such a co-operative transition include: place-based research with groups active in creating novel methods of production and distribution, configuration of academic partnerships to mirror cooperative work, the design and development of systems to infrastructure local cooperatives, the development of sociotechnical innovations for the dissemination of peer-to-peer methods of production and governance etc.    ",cs,325

His PhD concerned the application of speech technology (still quite a novel thing back in the late 1980s, where he worked with a Marconi Macrospeak speech recogniser, learning the rudiments of Unix to get the thing working), which was part-sponsored by a National electricity distribution company. So, he spent time visiting power stations and distribution centres to get an idea of how people did their work. During his PhD, he became interested in supporting speech recognition for mobile workers – which resulted in a large laptop, running the speech recogniser, in a rucksack, together with GPS antenna, and a small head-mounted, monocular television display, to read the words that had been recognised. Naturally, this led to working on wearable computers. Since then, he has shifted the sensors from the person onto everyday tools and objects in order to study the development and retention of human skill. Related to the wearable computers work, he developed technology for crime scene examination – which led to work on sense-making (that is, how crime scene examiners interpret a crime scene and select evidence), which led to work with Police and Intelligence analysts. This has led to work on how human decision making is supported by Artificial Intelligence, and to the study of human-machine teams. In all of this work, he combines an interest in studying human behaviour ‘in the field’ with the design and making of gadgets to measure or support activity.

Research interestsResearch-wise, I often view construction data/problems as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) that require a multilevel processing to support data-driven planning & control and decision-making. The ""micro-meso-macro"" framework has a great potential for embracing complexity of construction data/systems and informing data organisation to facilitate a multilevel planning & control. I also believe that new Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods and innovative ICTs offer a great opportunity to enhance connectivity across industries and promote automated planning & control, which are the two main features of Industry 4.0. However, the whole situation is further complicated by well-established beliefs and practices, and current structures of construction networks that limit its ability to improve performance. In alignment with this theoretically-informed thinking, I have supervised several MSc-by-research and PhD projects in different areas of Management of Projects. This has resulted in several academic papers. I am currently looking at Circular Economy CE in construction, from the transformational complex systems rather than from the technological linear systems point of view, to identify issues and challenges associated with the transformation to CE.

Research interestsMy current research follows two principal strands- development of analytical techniques for trace radioactive nuclides and control of radioactive contaminants in water-cooled nuclear reactor cooling circuits.
 Development of analytical techniques for trace radioactive nuclides 
There are several key radioactive isotopes which can be isolated from post-detonation samples to provide information on weapon physics and performance.  My research has allowed early quantification of a key diagnostic species (<1 day rather than 5-10 previously) and this has led to a change in approach to the UK nuclear diagnostics capability.
Radioactive contaminants in water-cooled nuclear reactor cooling circuits
This research is supporting the move to ‘fuelled for life’ reactor cores (PWR3) for the next generation of nuclear submarines. These have to operate without maintenance for 25 years or longer, and localised corrosion arising from formation and deposition of fine, highly contaminated particulate is potentially life-limiting. My research aims to provide confidence that PWR3 will perform as required.

Research interestsI am familiar with technical computing in MATLAB, including large dataset analysis, plotting and mapping. I have also used several crop models, GLAM, ORCHIDEE-Crop and APSIM. I typically run crop models as part of future climate simulations to identify vulnerable regions and assess the efficacy of adaptation methods.When not working on agriculture I have an interest in other climate impacts, including heat stress impact on people. In this topic I analyse climate model outputs and estimate the intensity and frequency of heat stress events in the developing world. My current project title is ""Climate resilient livelihoods"" whereby I am focusing on providing information to policy makers to reduce vulnerability of people in the developing world to climate shocks. One aspect of this includes using crop residue as a source of bioenergy.As an intense user of data from models, I am interested in uncertainties and am keenly aware of the value of bias correction. Below is list of project ideas I'm looking to collaborate on:

Research interestsThe world are facing disruptive technologies more than ever before. As such future societies must “cope with” discontinuous innovations. Business model research provides new agenda for managing “future projects”. Younger generation and particularly PM professionals need to prepare for, and lead for the delivery of step changes. Today’s smart technologies, for example, will drive and shape tomorrow’s bio-engineering, space manufacturing and connected transportations. 
This research focuses on how project learning (PL) can bring about sustainable product-service systems and responsible business models. PL as a powerful instrument for innovation has been promoted for decades. Examples of PL include use of resources (Huang and Li, 2012), project configuration (Midler and Siberzahn, 2008) and business model transformation (Muro and Turner, 2018; Zhang et al., 2015).

Research interestsDr. Lee’s current research interests include working with integrated assessment model (IAM) scenarios to determine the lifestyle implications of responding to a changing climate, particularly with regarding to changing food sources and diets. She is also particularly interested in developing research that links sustainable crop development with future needs and demands of a growing global population. Such demands include accessibility to foods in an urban environment, access to fresh fruit and vegetables, crops which supply the nutrients required by all age-groups, biofuel crops and fodder crops, catering for increasingly sophisticated tastes for exotic species, increased meat consumption in developing nations and increased vegetarianism in the developed world. 
 
Her research interests include:
Whole energy systems modelling and inter-connections between different sectors such as food, energy, transport and the built environmentBiogeochemical modelling of interactions between vegetation, climate and soilsThe impact of a changing climate on existing crops and the potential for growing new crops in parts of the world that were previously unfavourable climatically.Nutrients in food and fodder cropsThe health and structure of soils and the flow of nutrients through soil waterThe urban environment including resource flows in cities, vertical farming, air pollution and urban heat island effectsNutrients in food and fodder cropsThe health and structure of soils and the flow of nutrients through soil waterThe use of new technology and sensors in agriculture and its environmental, social and economic impacts

RESEARCH AREAS
Since I started my career in the late 1970s, my research interests have moved over several areas. I began with the hydraulics and sediment transport characteristics of gravel-bed rivers, carrying out both flume and field studies. I have maintained this interest over the decades and continue to publish on the topic, including spatial scale dependencies in sediment yield. I was a co-founder of the International Gravel-bed Rivers Workshops which have been held every five years from 1980.
From the 1980s I worked on the development and application of physically based, interdisciplinary, river catchment models (especially SHETRAN) as a core capability for land use and climate change impact assessment. In particular I developed this capability for soil erosion and sediment transport, including landslide erosion and sediment yield. Many of the applications were carried out in European Commission-funded projects, including the flagship MEDALUS projects on Mediterranean desertification. I also led a major project to transfer the SHETRAN modelling technology to the Chilean National Forestry Corporation (CONAF).
More recently the modelling work has led onto research into the catchment-scale hydrological impacts of forests, especially the relationship between forest cover and the peak flood discharge for extreme rainfall events. I led a European Commission-funded project which examined this topic in terms of the scientific evidence, integrated management of forest and water resources and policy recommendations relevant to four countries in Latin America. During my sabbatical in Chile I proposed some quantitative generalizations for estimating catchment sediment yield following logging. I am now supervising research into the extent to which catchment afforestation combined with riparian planting of trees on flood plains can reduce downstream flooding. 
CURRENT AND RECENT RESEARCH2013 On
sabbatical at the Universidad Austral de Chile at Valdivia supported by a grant
from Chile’s Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica
(CONICYT) within the programme Concurso Nacional de Atracción de Capital Humano
Avanzado del Extranjero (MEC contract 80120037). Published
data for temperate forests across the world were analyzed to investigate the
potential for generalized quantitative expressions of catchment sediment yield
impact in the years immediately following logging. The principal results were: 1) The maximum
increase in specific sediment yield (in t km-2 yr-1) following
logging is one order of magnitude above the control sediment yield at both the
annual and storm event scales, at least under normal circumstances of Best
Management Practice; 2) There is no apparent relationship between sediment yield
and the proportion of catchment logged, at least at the general scale; 3) A
cumulative probability distribution for the year in which the maximum post-logging
sediment yield occurs, shows the majority of cases falling in the first two
years. 
2009-12 Principal Investigator for Newcastle University component of European Commission-funded ForeStClim Interreg project. Development and application of forest hydrology model and visualisation tool (HYLUC and EXCLAIM) for showing the hydrological effects of forestry activities (e.g. planting different tree species) for present and future climates. Field study of the hydrological impact of a mature conifer plantation cover relative to open grassland on blanket peat, including spatial scale effects and the dependency of the impacts on climate change. (http://www.forestclim.eu/)
2005-8 Coordinator of the European Commission-funded EPIC FORCE project (Evidence-based Policy for Integrated Control of Forested River Catchments in Extreme Rainfall and Snowmelt) (3 EU partners, 5 Latin American partners) on the impact of forests on flood response for extreme rain events and the development of science-based policy for forest management in Latin America. The project results support the hypothesis that, as the size of the flood peak increases, the effect of forest cover becomes less important. Guidelines for integrated water and forest resources management have been developed that recognize this effect but emphasize the role that forests play in reducing the flood levels of more moderate events. The research findings have been transferred to policy-making for the four focus countries via a set of policy briefs, taking into account the institutional frameworks, achievable policy objectives and key stakeholders. Overall the project has shown how the integration of science, management and policy research can not only improve fundamental understanding of the underlying science but also recommend management and policy developments which are for use at the local, national and international level. The project has used an advance in scientific understanding to improve management practices and policy formulations which affect people and the environment in which they live.

SUMMARY OF RESEARCH PROJECTS
Developed the field of river basin erosion and sediment transport modelling at Newcastle University, based on the SHETRAN physically based and spatially distributed catchment modelling system, taking it into the new areas of landslide erosion modelling (DAMOCLES, LESSLOSS, MediGrid projects), decision support (MEDALUS, MEDACTION) and policy development (EPIC FORCE). Coordinator of the European Commission-funded DAMOCLES project (Debrisfall Assessment in Mountain Catchments for Local End-users)(6 EU partners, 2000-3) which integrated new modelling approaches for debris flow hazard assessment. The landslide modelling has included the development of a SHETRAN component for modelling the erosion and sediment yield produced by shallow landslides at the catchment scale, assessment of the impacts of land use and climate change on shallow landslide occurrence and sediment yield, and modelling landslide occurrence and sediment yield as a function of rainfall return period.

237,Professor Margaret Carol Bell CBE,https://www.ncl.ac.uk//engineering/staff/profile/margaretbell.html,"ResearchResearch Interests
Professor Bell's research has been mainly in the field of traffic and environment monitoring, modelling management and control. Professor Bell's research work, in chronological order, has included queuing of traffic at signal controlled junctions, plan change algorithms, ageing of traffic signal plans, statistical analyses of traffic data, development of congestion measures and demand management strategies, traffic control policy, state estimation to establish turning movements from detector flows, traffic modelling including assignment, signal optimisation. Air and noise pollution measurement and prediction, development of on-line traffic noise and air emissions models, forecasting air quality with novel statistical methods, the use of neural networks and fuzzy logic to forecasting duration of incidents, evaluation of the impact of fatal accidents, quantifying the impact on vehicle emissions of illegal car parking, development of strategies to manage event traffic and avoid ‘hotspot’ emissions, measurement of emissions from petrol and diesel engines to study the effect of driver behaviour, study of pollutant concentrations in street Canyons, investigation of traffic activity as a proxy measure for assessing health risk, the impact of traffic measures to reduce the exposure of school children to traffic related pollution, measurement of pedestrian exposure and the development of probability density functions for input to personal exposure models. Validation of pervasive monitoring systems for carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and noise and use of this data to estimate levels of roadside pollution using a canyon model, through integration of real-time traffic measurement use of pervasive sensors to characterise the microenvironments for air quality and noise in urban streets, evaluation of quality bus partnerships as a mechanism for increasing patronaga, decision support system for delivering transport sustainabiltiy through public transport interchange services; understanding travel behaviour and patterns on the carbon emissions from transport across congested urban environments. Underpinning the research activity is the role of Intelligent Transport Systems as technologies for delivering solutions and provider, in real time, spatially and temporally changing data sets.
Other Expertise
Act as an advisor to Local Authorities and Consultants. Knowledge transfer and engagement with Stakeholders, including school children, engineers, transport planners, air quality managers, traffic control engineers, consultants, information providers, health authorities etc. Supporting the commercialising of the mote technology, engaging in the setting up of a spin out company to deliver integration of mote with legacy system data.
Current Work
With colleagues management of the EPSRC:SUE3 4M project the TSB funded EVADINE project and the UKIERI project, funded by the British Council, to set up collaborative research with IIT Delhi and IIT Madras in India. PhD research support in the areas of the effect of driver behaviour on tailpipe emisisons, use of pervasive sensors to automatically create traffic management schemes to manage air quality. Win-win traffic management scenarios for air quality and carbon emissions. Public perceptions of quality delivered by Quality Bus Partnerships. Decision support systems for public transport interchange, Value of productive travel time in the use of ICT on trains and exposure and health impacts of traffic related air pollution.
Future Research
Research in the future will explore funding in parallel streams, acknowledging that the competition for funding will increase with the deterioration of the economic situation. Fundamental to the delivery of sustainability is conservation of energy and resources and transport provision underpins the processes that sustain life, movement of goods, travel to work, leisure, supply of energy etc. In the future there is a need to manage the demand to travel with the supply of energy. However, a balance needs to be achieved with zero impact on the environment and climate mindful that the population is increasing, in the UK from 60m to 80m by 2050. Therefore research in the future will look for systems equilibria which optimises networks to maximise people movements rather than minimising delay to single occupancy cars. There will be a need to understand the barriers to the use of public transport. In the future modelling of traffic networks cannot be carried out in isolation of other networks such as rail and public transport but instead through co-ordination of model outputs to create tools that can explore opportunities for public transport interchange. Challenges include understanding the changing needs of society to capture flexibility into the modelling framework. There is a need to understanding of the role of transport in supporting life, namely the provision of food, providing shelter, energy for heating, lighting and supporting activity (both in-house, leisure, work) at a micro scale in order to inform models at a strategic level. Sustainability has to be delivered at different spatial and temporal scales, managing schemes and systems that maximise returns at a local scale (every school a good school) whilst at the same time capitalising on the fact that some aspects of sustainability requiring strategic management across regions (for example offshore wind farms, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, investment in high speed rail) Research of importance is understanding the public response to change, how to deliver changes in attitudes, creating the research tools that are sufficiently sensitive and yet robust to model sustainability as well as the changing impacts that will result from the introduction of change. Future research will acknowledge the importance of delivering engineering solutions and creating the science base for informing policies that will make a difference. Such policies and schemes need to be created with due concern for their acceptability to the public and their impact, not only on carbon emission, but also on air quality, noise, exposure and health.

In  the early 1990’s he led major European Consortia which developed the basic  technologies for road user charging and tolling (PAMELA; ADEPT; and ADEPT II)  which largely formed the basis for the European DSRC-standards.  Much  of this research was funded under the EU’s DRIVE 1 and Drive 2 research  programmes in ITS.  A summary of the  DRIVE 1 projects can be found here  and and similarly for Drive 2  here.  During this time Phil was appointed chairman  of one of the seven Areas of the Programme, Area  1 Automated Debiting  which led to international recognition.    For the first ITS World Congress in Paris in 1994, the Commission  produced a video  of the activities and vision of the seven areas of the research programme which  is worth viewing just to gain a historical perspective on early ITS  innovation.In  the ADEPT projects he led the team that developed the first solution for  multi-lane tolling, the race to develop this solution is chronicled in the  Channel 4 Equinox documentary ‘ For whom the roads  toll’ available here  (a shortened version which just covers the ADEPT activities is available  here).  As part of this project he led the team that  implemented the Cambridge Congestion charging trial in 1993-94 (Co-funded by EU,  DfT and industry) and has been involved in most of the  major road user charging research initiatives across Europe including the review  of charging options for London (ROCOL) which delivered the feasibility study for  the subsequent implementation of the London Congestion Charging Scheme in  1999/2000 which led to the implementation of the London Congestion Charging  Scheme in 2003.  During the first decade  of 2000’s Phil advised many Government on road pricing and in the area of  electronic payment, including being a member of the cabinet offices office of  the e-Envoys smart card policy working group and the development of the National  Smart Card payment card for Transport, ITSO.Phil’s  research evolved into more general ITS and in  particular wireless systems and technologies to support mobility impaired and  older travellers.   Significant funding  for this came from both EPSRC and from a series of EU projects under the third  to seventh Framework research programmes.   This included research on smartcards for access to services (DISTINCT  Project) which led to the University adoption of smart card systems for student  cards, access cards and general campus cards – now even holding the Nexus Public  Transport e-Payment App. Is available on current student smart cards.   The concept of assistive mobility services  is captured well in a video  from the EU ASK-IT  project which included a major demonstration of the Technology across Newcastle  in both the ASK-IT and Veritas projects.   Much of the later work on this was undertaken in the RCUK Digital Economy  Hub project SiDE and a compilation of some of the TV  News Media reports on the research over this project can be found here.  Since  2010 Phils’ Research has focused in the areas of electromobility, connected and autonomous transport and  smartcities/big data as covered previously on this  page.  However with both his University  and DfT hats on he continues to advise and try and  bring transport challenges and ensure a horizon scanning of new and emerging  technologies and what they could potentially offer to together enable transport  policy to be delivered better, more optimally and joined up.  Hence the smart city, big data agendas are  fused with Automation, new business models, reduction and transport emissions  and mobility as a service.  A Foresight  project on the Future  of Mobility  which was launched earlier in 2017 to look the implications of this for future  transport and future policy and to inform Government and other transport  stakeholders. ",ce,446
240,Professor Rick Brassington,https://www.ncl.ac.uk//engineering/staff/profile/rickbrassington.html,"ResearchResearch Interests
I am interested in most aspects of applied hydrogeology particularly in relation to groundwater resources development and protection. I am currently researching aspects of the Derbyshire thermal groundwater system and yield losses in abstraction wells.
I am heavily involved in the continuing development of the School’s GEOMETRY (Groundwater Engineering Operations Monitoring Evaluation & Testing Laboratory) water well research facility based on the University’s farm at Cockle Park near Morpeth www.ncl.ac.uk/engineering/research/civil/water/geometry. The GEOMETRY group of boreholes focuses on hydrogeological field measurements and data interpretation. It is designed both as a research facility into the use of borehole tests to define the physical parameters of aquifers and on borehole operation and management and to provide a realistic environment for teaching a wide range of borehole-based hydrogeological field tests for the Applied Hydrogeology MSc and diploma courses. 
Other Expertise
I have first hand experience of working as a consultant in the commercial sector over the past 20 years.

The focus of my
research is the provision of tools and models to aid decision-makers.
Currently, I am developing spatial analytical tools within GIS for integrated
spatial modelling and assessment of climate change impacts and
socio-economic/land-use change. This work has involved both the development of
spatial interfaces to climate change outputs (e.g., EARWIG) and also
spatially-explicit models of city infrastructure for predictive land-use
modelling and climate change impact assessment (e.g., Tyndall Cities
programme). Recent work has
developed these concepts further to include the direct and indirect impacts of
climate events on city systems in the form of heatwaves or flood events. In ARCADIA, I have examined
the impact of extreme temperatures on railway networks and the knock-on effects
these disruptions can have on the wider urban economy. This work will be
further developed in RAMSES, including new climate hazards (e.g. extreme
rainfall and air quality) in order to better understand the true costs of
future climate change to urban areas.Another common theme in my research to date has been the integration and linking of data, processes, concepts and typologies from disparate application areas and specialist fields; my PhD research empowering the integration of various oil and gas datasets for decision-support, the EARWIG project linking expert models to provide a single user-oriented tool and the Tyndall Cities work providing a flow of data from land-use transport models to ward-level urban development simulation. This research has examined the interaction of both spatial and non-spatial data, giving me an appreciation of the numerous interactions which occur within the process of integrated assessment.
Working with a range of scientists, engineers and economists has also allowed me to gain an understanding of the role of spatial tools within the decision-support framework and the role of the spatial models within the greater adaptation and mitigation testing process. This has helped me broaden my experience of modelling processes and data fusion, examining the mapping of UK census data to socio-economic and industrial classifications and gaining an appreciation of the holistic and cross-disciplinary nature of the whole system approach to decision-making.

Development of transport cost models through complex network analysis.
Cellular automata modelling and multi-criteria analysis
Development of decision-support tools within commercial GIS software ensuring availability to a wide audience.

Hayley has more than 15 years experience analysing the impacts of climate change and variability on hydrological systems and has published more than 90 ISI-cited articles since 2000. She has a large research group - currently 7 post-docs and 5 PhD students.She specialises in the analysis of the impacts of climate change and variability on hydrological and water resources systems, in particular examining recent trends in extremes and future projections and their impacts on flood and drought risks. She has also been instrumental in the analysis of climate model outputs and the development of new downscaling techniques, in particular the use of probabilistic methods and weather or rainfall generators, to bridge the gap between climate modellers and users of climate information. Her current funded research includes four main themes: i) improving projections of extreme rainfall change by developing high-resolution regional climate models to understand convective processes; ii) examining climatic changes in the Karakoram Himalaya and their impacts on hydrology and water resources; iii) producing new downscaling methods to enable improved climate information services for Europe; and iv) developing web-based tools to allow downscaling methods to be used for climate change impact assessments outside academia.

254,Dr Rachel Gaulton,https://www.ncl.ac.uk//engineering/staff/profile/rachelgaulton.html,"ResearchCurrent WorkMy research is focussed on the use of remote sensing technology (ground-based, airborne and satellite) in measuring and monitoring vegetation structure and dynamics, especially in forested and agricultural environments. I have particular interests in the estimation of forest and crop health, including vegetation stress and disease detection. Active projects include the use of novel dual-wavelength laser scanner technologies in measuring leaf and canopy physiological parameters such as water content, in collaboration with Salford University, use of thermal imaging for tree disease detection, and monitoring of agricultural crop health for precision farming applications. I have particular interests in the calibration and validation of low-cost and novel sensors for unmanned aerial vehicle platforms and the application of UAV imaging in ecology, agriculture and forestry. I also have ongoing interests in the use of satellite imagery for  long-term mapping and monitoring of vegetation change at regional  extents, as a result of human and natural disturbances, including a current project examining drought resilience in rural communities in China. Past work has included the fusion of Landsat and MODIS imagery for  generating a high temporal and spatial resolution disturbance sequence  over a grizzly bear habitat area in western Canada, the use of a  physiological forest growth model (3-PG) for predicting forest volume  and growth changes under current and future climatic conditions, and  mapping of forest canopy gaps and quantifying spatial aspects of forest  structure from airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data (in collaboration  with the UK Forestry Commission). Main expertise

Dr Hall’s research interests focus on three main themes; the geotechnical implications of the legacy of coal mining (with particular applications in understanding the presence of CO2 in the near surface environment); the ability to assess and change the in-situ engineering properties of materials in response to conductivity drivers; the implementation of the use of EKG in cross discipline applications for dewatering and stabilisation of material. My current research is industry-focussed and collaborates strongly to try and solve the ‘real’ problems experienced by practitioners in the Engineering Geology industry. Her expertise is in field applications of experimental research and concept of proof for industry. Examples of this current research in progress are projects with TerraConsult Ltd (an Environmental consultancy) on CO2 in the near surface environment, Electrokinetic Ltd (University spin-out company) in the use of EKG in dewatering waste products and Aggregate Industries on Rockfall hazard appraisal systems different projects.

264,Professor Chris Kilsby,https://www.ncl.ac.uk//engineering/staff/profile/chriskilsby.html,"ResearchChris began his research career at the Met Research Flight of the UK Met Office carrying out research into radiation transfer in the atmosphere for use in climate change modelling.  He moved to Newcastle University where he started work as a Research Associate on Mediterranean climate change and hydrology and large scale hydrological modelling.  Since then he has researched many aspects of the water sector, particularly focussed on extremes and climate change impacts and adaptation,  ranging from drought to flood risk. 
The scope of the work has been from small catchments up to continental scale and has covered many parts of the world.  An increasing emphasis in recent years has been on the hydrology and drainage of cities, increasingly in the context of climate change impacts and adaptation responses.
A major theme has been the use of simulation models for both generating rainfall sceanrios as well as simulating hydrologic and hydraulic responses of natural and man-made infrastructure systems. Much of this work has used stochastic approaches for rainfall and climate scenario modelling. His recent work includes leading the Weather Generator component of the UKCP09 national climate scenarios. He is Senior Academic for Newcastle's involvement with the Willis Research Network : Willis are a leading  international insurance broker and the research is directed at improving understanding and simulation of flood risk worldwide.

To this end, I perform high-performance simulations using the Discrete Element Method (DEM), molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo. I am also interested in the multi-scale modelling (length and time scales) of the rheology, mechanics, and ageing of cementitious materials. To this end, I use thermodynamic modelling, kinetic modelling, and homogenization theory.In addition to modelling, I do experimental research on the hydration and nanostructre development of cementitious materials. My focus here is on alkali activation, cement replacements (e.g. fly ash), and on chemical synthesis of hydration products with controlled sub-micrometre morphology.Main research themes- Nanostructure and nanomechanics of cement paste: precipitation from solution, creep, and ageing (modelling and experiments)- Multi-scale modelling of cement paste and concrete: setting, hardening, sorption, and shrinkage (modelling)- Engineering cement hydration: alkali activation and seeding (modelling and collaborative experiments)- Collapse of buildings (modelling)Funded research projects:- Grant EP/S013997/1 - Engineering Microbial-Induced Carbonate Precipitation via Meso-Scale SimulationsCollaborations, network, community: Due to its multi-scale and multi-disciplinary nature, my research lends itself well (and necessarily) to collaborations and networking. the disciplinary areas that I am involved with encompass: structural engineering, materials science, computational mechanics, statistical mechanics, physical chemistry, cement science, and concrete technology.",ce,116

The geomorphic effect and destructive potential of landslides is driven by their timing, size and location. As a mathematically minded geomorphologist with expertise in landslide mechanics I am seeking to improve our understanding of the timing, size and location of landslides on natural slopes. I specialise in development of simple mathematical models to examine the drivers and impacts of landslides, in the development and application of remote sensing tools to collect landslide data; and in the application of these models and dataset to address real problems for those exposed to landslide hazards worldwide. I also have an ongoing interest in catchment hydrology and in particular in the impact of natural flood management on streamflow. Some areas of current or recent research include:Analytical slope stability modelsLandslides and landscape evolutionLandslide size and shapeInteractions between climate, vegetation and geomorphic processes (especially landslides)Landslide detection from optical and SAR satellite imagerySimple rules for landslide hazardCo-seismic loess landslidesLandslide forecasting from rainfall characteristics and ground surface displacementI am always looking for enthusiastic and curious potential PhD students with an academic background in earth or environmental science, hydrology, geotechnical engineering, geography, mathematics or physics.

This concept is partly biomimetic inspired by, for example, the way in which our bones strengthen, becoming more dense under repeated load. However, we are also proposing to build this system using living bacteria cells which have no such functional requirement in nature.Soil-structure interaction under long term cyclic loading.

#. NERC CADTIME  (Clean Air for Delhi Through Interventions, Mitigations and Engagement)The Clean Air for Delhi Through Interventions, Mitigations and Engagement (CADTIME) project aims to understand what is required to deliver significant reductions in levels of air pollution, within the confines of factors which are under our control, through affordable, effective interventions that consider and respond to future changes. CADTIME brings together a consortium of institutions and experts from across both India and the United Kingdom with the goal of addressing air quality issues that affect people's health in Delhi. This goal will be achieved through the development of an Integrated Action Plan (IAP), detailing strategies and potential interventions for mitigating air pollution in both the city, and surrounding region.

#. EPSRC SUE Project SECURE (SElf Conserving Urban Environments)The SECURE project addresses the grand challenge of integrating greater conservation and more efficient resource utilisation across scales to meet future urban demands. SECURE is developing a Regional Urbanisation Model that synthesises resource-supply-demand-waste systems from city and local authorities to regional scales via the integration of three themes - Urbanisation (land use and transport), Building and Energy (supply and demand) and Ecosystem Services (the benefits humans receive from ecosystems).The SECURE project comprises five Work Packages. The first three focus on the main research areas, Urbanisation, Ecosystem Services, and Building and Energy. Work Package 4 addresses the issue of Societal Impact and Professional Engagement, ensuring that stakeholders are fully engaged both in terms of the technical development of the Base Case (2011) and Projection (2016), and public acceptability of longer term Scenarios (2030/2050). Work Package 5, Integration of Policies Across Themes, ensures that the policies identified and developed throughout the course of the project are fully integrated, both in terms of their proposed design and implementation, and their overall impact in meeting the project objectives.#. UKIERI Project - NAMPSER (Newcastle and Mumbai Partnership on Sustainability and
Environment Research)Collaborators: Newcastle University, UK and IIT Bombay, IndiaThe main aim of this project is to develop collaboration
between Newcastle University and IIT Bombay on topics dealing with some of the
most challenging issues faced by developed and developing countries alike viz.
traffic congestion, air pollution and health. This will involve exchange of
academic and research staff and postgraduate students working together to
contribute complementary skills to currently on-going projects and to carry out
some pilot studies leading to the development of joint research proposals and publications.
This will enhance ongoing efforts to strengthen current practice in India/UK
involving urban administrative authorities and regulatory agencies for
sustained and holistic approach to traffic and air quality management.  #. EPSRC Global SECURE ProjectIn collaboration with the Peking University and Wuhan University, China.International engagement to focus on crucial technological challenges which can support substantial energy reductions and a supply of clean, secure energy.  To enhance existing UK-China research relationships, build new links with the top universities in China, and strengthen the competitiveness of Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in the UK and China.  The project is highly relevant to the UK government’s energy strategy to secure the future energy supply and achieve national targets for greenhouse gas emissions.#. EPSRC SUE Project 4M (Measurement, Modelling, Mapping and ManagementAn Evidence-Based Methodology for Understanding and Shrinking the Urban Carbon Footprint). 2008-2012. The 4M project seeks to investigate how much carbon the city produces - and looks at ways it can be cut. It seeks to place calculations of the Carbon Footprint of cities on a secure platform and produce a carbon emissions inventory for the whole city of Leicester. Four topic areas are being studied: building energy, reduction of emissions and pollution from transport, carbon sequestration rates and impact of personal carbon quotas. The project is in partnership with De Montfort, Leicester, Loughborough, Sheffield and Leeds universities.
#. EPSRC SUE Project ReVISIONS (Regional Visions of Integrated Sustainable Infrastructure Optimised for NeighbourhoodS)2008-2012. ReVISIONS project is in collaboration with Cambridge, Newcastle, Exeter, Leeds universities and Imperial College London. In ReVISIONS, the research will be carried out within an integrated modelling framework to understand how regional 'top down' spatial development policies would affect the size and densities of settlements and identify the most sustainable combinations of infrastructure at different spatial scales and locations. My role in ReVISIONS would be in environmental modelling and overall assessment of various options. Each option will be assessed across a wide range of criteria encompassing the environmental impacts, use of resources, economy, social inclusion, and health.
#. EPSRC SUE Project. SOLUTIONS (Sustainability Of Land Use and Transport In Outer NeighbourhoodS). 2004-2009. main aim of the SOLUTIONS project was to develop generic guidance to support the planning, design and implementation of sustainable land use and transport strategies in peri-urban areas that experience high pressure for growth. SOLUTIONS was a collaborative project with Cambridge University, University of West England, University of Leeds and University College London. The principal research questions that SOLUTIONS answered was how far, and by what means, can towns and cities be planned so they are socially inclusive, economically efficient and environmentally sustainable. See a key publication on the findings here.

Geoff's interests in understanding and modelling catchment processes began with his PhD as one of the developers of the SHETRAN software model, a leading physically-based hydrological modelling system which has had worldwide application over the last 15 years. Following on from development of major catchment instrumentation and monitoring studies in the UK (the CHASM programme), he is now leading the climate/hydrology field monitoring and modelling aspects of an initiative at the Iwokrama International Centre, a forest reserve in Guyana, South America, aimed at sustainable forest management and assessment of water and carbon related forest ecosystem services. 
His interests in water management have included high profile studies, including the DfID-funded project “Sustainable Management of the West Bank and Gaza Aquifers” (SUSMAQ) which provided capacity building for the Palestinian water sector and modelling of the transboundary (Israel-Palestine) Western Aquifer Basin, institutional analysis and water resources assessment of the endangered Lake Urmia in north-west Iran (one of the largest endorheic salt lakes on Earth), and recently development of a full model for the Nile basin, for use in transboundary water management between the 9 countries in the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI).

I am currently heavily involved in assessing the quality of ocean tide models, and determining the anelastic properties of the Earth using GPS, as well as using global GPS to improve the confidence of vertical land movement monitoring for sea level and post-glacial rebound studies. In particular, in recent years I have extensively investigated features in GPS time series, particularly the cause of semi-annual and annual signals, plus higher frequency noise, in order to improve the confidence with which GPS can be used in geophysical studies, particularly height determination. Directly linked to this is GPS's ability to estimate atmospheric water vapour, and I've worked closely with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to investigate the application of GPS to improving Australian numerical weather prediction.

What is the future of our landscape? How do we use data, models and proactive land management strategies to create a functioning and thriving landscape for all who use it? The long term goal is to set up integrated catchment management bodies capable of solving pollution and flooding problems whilst benefitting all who those who contribute to the solution (which includes professional bodies, industry and the public). Catchment Systems Engineering forms part of Earth System Engineering and looks to altering the water quantity and quality entering our rivers, using soft engineering and through active uptake by farmers and policy makers. Gathering data through state of the art instrumentation and then using models and GIS tools analyse them, produces the evidence base required to influence policy makers.

Current Work
I am currently working on the EU-funded INTENSE project examining characteristics of sub-daily rainfall and its drivers.  I have produced a quality-controlled hourly rainfall dataset for the UK and am currently working on a corresponding sub-hourly dataset.  I have also recently worked on projects examining Himalayan climate variability.  I have also worked on the NERC-funded CONVEX and SINATRA projects, undertaking analysis of the spatial and temporal characteristics of rainfall through the examination of hourly gauge data.  I also worked on the EPSRC-funded SWERVE (Severe Weather Events Risk and Vulnerability Estimator) project.  This assessed the impacts of extreme weather on the SE London area, deriving probabilistic projections for a range of weather-related hazards such as flooding, heatwaves, wind and subsidence.  This was achieved by using and developing datasets, tools and methodologies which form part of the UKCP09 output.I have co-authored ~40 peer-reviewed journal articles.

My main interest is in the applicability and application of thermodynamic logic to microbial processes and interactions in methanogenic ecosystems.Simple high school chemistry goes a long way to explaining and indeed understanding the hierarchy of microbial niches in the environment and the processes that these organisms catalyse. This approach resulted in, for example, the formulation of the hypothesis that microorganisms can obtain energy for growth from reductive dechlorination of halogenated organic compounds, a hypothesis that was subsequently experimentally validated.Other examples are the rationalisation of why syntrophs in methanogenic ecosystems catalyse incomplete oxidation of organic compounds to acetate and H2, and the “window of opportunity” concept for the methanogenic biodegradation of crude oil.Current ideas revolve around a more in-depth understanding of the interactions and ecophysiology of the organisms involved in interspecies hydrogen transfer. Ultimately, this modelling and experimentation based understanding will allow us to better engineer or engineer better anaerobic wastewater treatment systems.

ITS Observatory (EU; 2015-2017) - I manage two work packages (user requirements and evaluation) on this project. The Observatory will be an intelligent tool to provide accessible and comprehensive information on ITS deployments and initiatives across Europe. Its development and launch will bridge knowledge fragmentation across Europe by creating a common EU-wide database for ITS and will support ITS deployment by creating an intelligent software platform with results and 'success stories' from deployments, research and pilot schemes. Benefits and impacts, information on standardisation and policy guidelines, as well as interactive functionality (peer to peer brokerage, user forum, Q&A, etc.) will enhance usability of the platform.C-ITS Smart Corridor Newcastle (DfT/NCC; 2016-18) - I manage the evaluation work on this project, focusing in particular on vulnerable road users (VRU). Building on the success of Compass4D, which demonstrated that co-operative ITS (C-ITS) technology can be used to provide safety, fuel efficiency and air quality benefits, TORG is working with Newcastle City Council, the DfT, Arriva and Siemens UK to equip over 30 express buses and 18 intersections on a key arterial route ('Gosforth Corridor') in Newcastle. Data analysis and evaluation will take place to measure the safety and environmental impacts of the technology, with additional use cases examining how C-ITS can benefit other road users including VRUs,(specifically cyclists), and lead to improvements in not only bus operations but also freight and taxi operations. the impact on driver and passenger experiences will also be evaluated.This section lists successful funding bids with which I have been involved (value to TORG in parentheses):

My contribution to the project was the development of a high-level analysis of the impacts of climate change on flooding, droughts and heat-waves in all European cities. This hazard assessment was combined with a vulnerability and exposure assessment in order to have an indication of the risk that climate change poses to European cities.  For my PhD I assessed the “Future climate impacts on drought and water resources in international Iberian basins”. This encompassed: statistical analysis of observed historical rainfall for Iberia (Portugal and Spain); evaluation of future climate projections from CMIP5 climate models for Iberia and running the hydrological model SHETRAN to assess changes in flows.   Media attentionhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/21/climate-change-will-push-european-cities-towards-breaking-pointhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5414223/Europes-cities-face-extreme-weather-thought.htmlhttps://www.carbonbrief.org/climate-change-could-cause-more-severe-droughts-98-per-cent-european-cities?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A carbonbrief %28The Carbon Brief%29https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/british-cities-among-threatened-europe-flooding-caused-climate-change-study/https://news.sky.com/story/british-isles-worst-for-flooding-as-europe-hits-breaking-point-11259069https://www.cbsnews.com/news/europeans-should-gird-for-extreme-weather/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/which-irish-cities-will-be-hardest-hit-by-flooding-in-the-future-1.3402451http://www.corriere.it/cronache/18_febbraio_21/ondate-calore-estreme-siccita-cosi-30-anni-cambieranno-citta-italiane-b191577a-16ea-11e8-b630-41a05c9e9642.shtml#commentFormAnchor?refresh_ce-cphttp://www.lescienze.it/news/2018/02/22/news/europa_cambiamento_climatico-3873161/?rsshttp://visao.sapo.pt/actualidade/sociedade/2018-02-27-Se-nao-fizermos-nada-ha-cidades-na-Europa-que-vao-ficar-submersas-e-outras-que-podem-ficar-sem-aguahttp://www.independent.co.uk/environment/spain-portugal-megadroughts-eight-fifteen-years-2100-study-drought-newcastle-university-a7757036.htmlhttp://sicnoticias.sapo.pt/pais/2017-05-26-Portugal-pode-ser-atingido-por-longos-periodos-de-secahttp://www.dn.pt/lusa/interior/portugal-pode-ser-atingido-por-periodos-de-seca-de-dez-ou-mais-anos-ate-2100---estudo-8510645.htmlInterviewed for the BBC television documentary “Weather World” about future heatwaves in Europe (2015);Interviewed for the RTP (Portugal) evening news regarding the future river flow in Portuguese rivers (2017)",ce,292

Currently I am working on the EPSRC funded ACHILLES project with my work primarily focussed on the modelling of the deterioration of geotechnical infrastructure subject to annual weather cycles 
This involves modelling of the effects of meteorological parameters on pore
water pressures in infrastructure slopes and how this in turn affects their

the geomechanics modelling code FLAC (with the two phase flow add on to allow
the modelling of partially saturated flow behaviour).In the past I worked as a research associate on the ESPRC iSMART project and as a research assistant on the BIONICS project (Biological and engineering impacts of climate on slopes) and was seconded into a consultancy firm where I undertook validation of their finite element software for use in slope stability analysis.",ce,254

I was involved in the mathematical modelling of anaerobic digestion processes in the framework of the BBSRC sLOLA funded project ""Engineering synthetic microbial communities for biomethane production"".The work involved the development and analysis of simplified ODE type mathematical models of sub-processes (or motifs) describing microbial interactions in an anaerobic context. These motifs describe typical ecological phenomena at the microbial level, such as syntrophy, competition, and mutualism. The stability of these systems are elucidated by solving the models analytically and describing their general character in relation to the parameters of the system. However, for increasingly complex models with three or more organisms, numerical analysis is required and only local stability may be adequately described for some steady-states. Nevertheless, this provides the opportunity observe emergent properties of the system given perturbations in the operational conditions, or from a synthetic biology perspective, to understand the importance of the microbes themselves in determining process behaviour.Coupling this analysis with parameter sensitivity studies, and linking information gained from modern molecular techniques and metabolic modelling work, it is anticipated that the performance of anaerobic digestion processes can be tailored based on a greater understanding of the microbial community.

328,David Walker,https://www.ncl.ac.uk//engineering/staff/profile/davidwalker4.html,"ResearchThis research position followed immediately from my PhD, which was titled:  ""Resilience of shallow groundwater resources and their potential for use in small-scale irrigation: a study in Ethiopia"". The following ongoing projects commenced during my PhD: Sep 2016 – present: REACH Improving Water Security for the Poor – Water security risk science: local monitoring for participatory resource management (AMGRAF-WSRS) The focus of the Catalyst project was participatory monitoring at community scale as an approach to enhancing climate and hydrological monitoring, particularly for shallow groundwater. The Accelerated project builds on this research to advance a methodology for monitoring the impacts of watershed management interventions using selected indicators of hydrological performance, and will develop a tool for targeting interventions that increase groundwater recharge. The project aims to consolidate community engagement through a gender inclusive approach. The project is partnered with the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MoANR) and International Water Management Institute (IWMI), and operates at four study sites in Ethiopia.  Jan 2017 – present: NERC Innovations Water Risk project – CARISMA (Catchment Risk Assessments using Multi-Scale data) The aim is to develop a framework methodology for integration of community-led hydrological monitoring in areas of data scarcity in sub-Saharan Africa with remote sensing information, to improve assessment and understanding of catchment water balances. The project focuses on two river basins, one each in Ethiopia and Tanzania, working with key stakeholders representing different interests (including communities, environmental organisations, industrial water users, government bodies) to design and evaluate a prototype software integration platform / water management toolkit to allow multiple stakeholders within a river catchment to visualise and interpret hydrological information in support of catchment-based water management. The project is in collaboration with Imperial College London, WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature), the Abay River Basin Authority in Ethiopia, and the Rufiji Basin Water Office in Tanzania. Dec 2017 – present: The Royal Society Global Challenges – PAPPADAAM (Pluri-scalar Approaches for co-Production of Pan-Asian Drought Assessment and Adaptive resource Management) To address threats from environmental disasters, specifically drought, we utilise approaches, which are both pluri-scalar – ranging from individual communities to continental extents – and trans-disciplinary, drawing upon environmental science (climatology, remote sensing, agronomy) and people-focused activities (participatory monitoring, resource management, policy uptake). By focusing on a water-forestry-agriculture nexus our research yields valuable insights on increasing resilience to drought for the institutions and countries (in China, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) with whom we partner.   ",ce,42

Paul's current research addresses equatorial scintillation and the validation of a new concept Networked Over the Horizon Radar.
Historical 
After early periods in the universities and in the satellite communications industry Paul was appointed to the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Royal Aircraft Establishment (Laboratory). He was offered a fast track career in London, which he declined preferring a research career.
Paul's early work on meteor burst communications (MBC) was significant in that he was the first to identify a signal loss mechanism due to signal polarisation rotation by the ionosphere, in the upper atmosphere. This, and subsequent work on the use of phased arrays, facilitated MBC systems operating with significantly enhanced data rates. These early successes convinced him that important radio engineering advances could be made via a detailed understanding of both the radio propagation and the atmospheric environment through which those signals propagate. Around this time (1989) paul was invited to work on sabbatical at the University of Massachusetts.
Subsequent R&D resulted in the development of new and novel instrumentation to measure the ionosphere, new fast analytic ray tracing techniques and non-linear dynamical modelling to forecast the ionosphere. These many initiatives have provided innovative solutions to problems in ionospheric radio systems. Of particular note was the pioneering work and Paul's leadership (technical and managerial) of the international DAMSON programme (1993-2000) to measure and understand the HF communications propagation channel. This work, carried out by a team of ~10 persons in Sweden, Norway, Canada and the UK was carried out in cooperation with the major communications modem manufacturers. NATO’s robust HF modems are based on the results of this work.
Until 2013 Paul led the QinetiQ team delivering new techniques to support the design of innovative new sensors based around space radars, over-the-horizon-radar and other surveillance systems. This included formal assimilation of measured data into models and ionospheric scintillation measurements and modelling using phase screen approaches. During this time, he was the first to measure the trans-ionospheric impulse response which he did using a major radar facility located in the Marshall Islands. This period has included investigations of the practical effects of climate change on the ionosphere. During this period, Paul also undertook, in partnership with colleagues in the USA, artificial ionospheric modification measurements which included launching sounding rockets into the upper atmosphere.
Subsequent research at the University of Birmingham addressed the effects of the ionosphere on space-based radars. One result of this research was the development of a new technique to map the strength of ionospheric turbulence using a space-based radar.

Sean's research is focused on two main themes: upper atmosphere forecasting and extreme statistics and risk analysis.
For forecasting, Sean is developing new models to produce accurate and actionable forecasts of the ionosphere and thermosphere (regions of the Earth's upper atmosphere). These forecasts could be used by space weather operational centres to help protect critical systems.
Sean is also interested in using extreme value theory to rigorously determine the probability of extreme space weather events. With very few data points of extreme events it is important to appropriately quantify the future likelihood of such events.
Sean is currently the Principal Investigator on two Space Weather Instrumentation, Measurement, Modelling and Risk (SWIMMR) projects. SWIMMR is a £20 million, four-year programme that will improve the UK's capabilities for space weather monitoring and prediction. The funding forms part of the Strategic Priorities Fund (SPF), delivered by the UK Research & Innovation (UKRI) to drive an increase in high quality multi- and interdisciplinary research and innovation. It will ensure that UKRI's investment links up effectively with government research priorities and opportunities.

Research 
As head of the Railway Research Group's traction systems research, Dr Hillmansen has developed key themes, built up its reputation internationally in both academic circles and industry and co-ordinated its dissemination. 
Developing key themes 
Improving the energy efficiency of railway systems relies on frontline developments in railway traction systems. Developing and testing cutting edge hypothesis in this field not only creates interesting and challenging PhD programmes for the team, but ensures that the practical applications of the research are timely and of great importance to both industry and the Department for Transport (DfT) both of whom have carbon reduction strategies. This has led to a number of deployments with direct or collaborative funding. Software developed by Dr Hillmansen’s team for train simulation and optimisation is not only being currently applied on the UK's railways but also internationally through collaborations outside the EU in the USA and far east. An example is the application of the simulator to the assessment of new rolling stock designs on the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit system. Previously the software was applied to other high-speed routes in the UK to support the development of the Government's technical specification for the next generation of high speed rolling stock (2007-8). Advanced instrumentation systems designed by Dr Hillmansen’s team are deployed in passenger services in the UK. These include instrumented vehicles and infrastructure on the Merseyrail network (with direct funding from the DfT and co-funding by EPSRC). 
Industry
The dissemination activities of the group regularly attract the attention of the industry and we often showcase our work in high-level meetings with senior members of high profile companies. The group work closely with Atkins rail group and are participating in a KTP with them. Our multi-train simulator will be fully incorporated in Atkins' suite of rail related design and analysis tools. Dr Hillmansen is principle investigator of the Energy Storage and Integration Laboratory (established in April 2010 and funded by AWM and ERDF through the Science City programme) that supports the research through cutting edge experimentation and validation of simulation studies. The laboratory has already generated significant interest from the industry, and has been featured in railway and engineering publications. The laboratory will support our long term research aspirations and will help translate the outputs from our research into tangible industry impacts. 
UK profile
Recognition of the value of Dr Hillmansen’s research can be seen from the invites from key UK bodies. The Government's Energy and Climate Change Select Committee requested Dr Hillmansen’s evidence (both oral and written (2008)) to inform their report on Low Carbon Technologies in a Green Economy. The DfT's Technical Strategy Advisory Group requested Dr Hillmansen’s contribution in developing a future strategy for energy for the railway industry (2008). Dr Hillmansen also has been invited to contribute to the development of the future technical strategy of the railway, and have supported the Government's Technical Strategy Advisory Group on a number of occasions. Since 2005, Dr Hillmansen has been a member of the DfT chaired Future Fuels Technology Group. The group regularly present their results to The Railway Industry Association, the Railway Safety and Standards board and the Vehicle Train Energy System Interface. The IMechE appointed Dr Hillmansen as an editorial board member (Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineering Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit) and as a member of the Conferences and Seminars Committee 
International profile
On the international stage Dr Hillmansen is heavily involved with EU FP7 research projects, and is principle investigator on two projects. Both projects are likely to lead onto significant future funding. Dr Hillmansen co-chaired the 4th International Railway Traction Systems Conference attended by delegates from the UK, the USA, Australia, Far East and the EU. Dr Hillmansen is regularly invited to address international conferences (including high profile conferences in Japan and Hong Kong) and to peer review papers from international journals. The group are collaborating with Vehicle Projects INC in the USA, who have developed a number of fuel cell demonstrators (including a switcher locomotive), and have jointly prepared an article for publication. In Singapore, our simulator is being used to assess the performance of the latest rolling stock running on their metro. 
Publications 
Results from Dr Hillmansen’s research has been published in literature and are published in numerous conferences. The research is now established and the rate of publications is about 4-5 journal papers per year and which is in addition to several conferences (attended by the research team and students).

HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION  He conducts research on various aspects of processing of acoustic speech signals as part of human interaction with computers, in particular in noisy environments. This includes: i) extraction of information from the acoustic speech signal that characterises its production; ii) acoustic modelling of speech signals; iii) dealing with noise; iv) paralinguistic signal processing, such as, recognition of speaker or an emotional state of a speaker based on the acoustic and brain neural signals; v) analysis of children speech. This research has over last few years been funded by two EPSRC projects. The main research topics are briefly outlined below.    Speech and Speaker Recognition in Noisy Environments  While current automatic speech and speaker recognition systems can achieve high performance in carefully controlled environments, their performance degrades rapidly when they are applied in real-world situations due to the presence of a background environmental noise. We conduct research on novel methods for noise-robust feature extraction and noise compensation. This includes methods for noise-robust combination of multiple features, which may be obtained by using different sources of information or different processing techniques applied on a specific source, and methods for improving acoustic modelling of speech, specifically, by employing the information about both the vocal tract and excitation.    Speech Signal Enhancement  The goal of speech enhancement is to estimate the original signal from a given noise-corrupted signal. Signal can be recorded using a single microphone (single-channel) or multiple microphones (multi-channel). The use of multiple microphones can enable to estimate the direction of arrival of the sound source and thus to further reduce the noise. We carry out research on development of richer techniques for single-channel and multi-channel speech enhancement which can better exploit the statistical properties of the signal and the intrinsic properties of speech signals.    AUDIO / MUSIC PATTERN PROCESSING    Recognition of Bird Species from their Songs  In this work, we study the problem of automatic detection and recognition of bird species from their song. The objective is to create an automatic system which can detect individual occurrences of the song of a particular species of bird over a period of several days, in order to establish whether or not that species is resident in the locality. This research involves applying pattern recognition techniques which have been demonstrated to be effective for computer speech recognition and their modifications to birdsongs. The outcomes of our research so far showed that the proposed techniques can achieve high detection accuracy of bird vocalisations and high recognition accuracy of bird species based on their songs in real-world noisy conditions.    Analysis of Musical Signals  During recent years, there has been a huge increase of the amount of various types of multimedia data available in digital format on the internet. This has created a large demand for development of automatic intelligent tools that could organise and search through this data, or extract knowledge from this data. The objective of this research is to investigate novel techniques for automatic processing of musical data, for instance, recognition of instruments or note transcription in polyphonic music, analysis of song structure, genre classification. The research involves applying of signal processing and machine learning techniques.    RADAR TARGET CLASSIFICATION  In this work, we study the feasibility of forward scattering radar for automatic ground target classification. Our study provides important results in the area that currently contains only few theoretical works with very limited experimental confirmation. The obtained results indicate that the proposed signal processing has a wide range of potential applications in military and protection against terrorism, e.g., an early warning system to protection of airports and power stations. This work is in collaboration with Prof. M. Cherniakov at our school and with Bauman University, Moscow, Russia. This work has been funded by DTC.    BIOMEDICAL DATA ANALYSIS  In this interdisciplinary project, we worked on analysis of the risk of an individual having a colorectal cancer based on family history (pedigree consisting of 6,800 individuals covering four or more generations) in collaboration with Coventry University and the Newfoundland Memorial Hospital in Canada.

These fundamental studies have enabled innovative applications in making liquid metal-based microactuators, such as micropumps, micromixers, microvalves, and micromotors without any conventional moving parts. These actuators have been used for manipulating fluidic samples in microfluidic devices and driving robotic systems. 
Discovered new phenomena including 1) the unconventional positive piezoconductive effect in liquid metal-filled hybrid conductive elastic composites, i.e. the conductivity of the composite dramatically increases upon the application of a tensile strain; and 2) phase separation of liquid metal nanoparticles for forming stable spherical solid-core/liquid-shell structure without the support of a crystalline substrate.
Developed various innovative microfluidic and MEMS platforms for 1) constructing integrated lab-on-a-chip systems; 2) realizing versatile microdroplet-based systems for biological assays; and 3) producing stable and biofunctional liquid metal nanoparticles to enable their applications in nanomedicine.

RESEARCH ACTIVITY 
Biomedical Electrical Engineering
Over the last 10 years Edward has been developing sensors and systems which can be used to detect bioelectric signals. This began with the use of SQUIDs to detect biomagnetic fields, but is now centred on microfabricated electrode arrays. These arrays are based on polymeric materials which are processed using microfabrication techniques. Polymers have the advantage over materials such as silicon of a lower Young’s modulus, which results in more flexible and softer devices, better matched to the mechanical properties of nervous tissue. The flexibility makes it possible to construct devices such as the Spiral Peripheral Nerve Interface (SPNI) which is fabricated using photolithography as a flat structure on a silicon handle wafer and then rolled to fit the three dimensional structure of a nerve. This device contains channels, into which regenerating nerve fibres grow, with electrodes in the base. These channels not only guide the fibres past the electrodes, the confinement of the extracellular fluid causes the voltage detected by the electrodes to be enhanced. These technologies are being applied to a range of other applications in neuroscience and electrophysiology. We are also interested in using nanotechnology to enhance the performance of these devices by nanotexturing the surfaces of the electrodes and other areas of the devices, to decrease electrochemical impedance and enhance biocompatibility. In addition, we are developing finite element models for the electrodynamic behaviour of bioelectric sources.

Dr Yi Wang’s research falls in the Communications and Sensing theme and he is a member of Emerging Device Technologies research group. His main research activities are:
Microwave device technology and theory
Many new challenges facing the world are finding solutions from microwave (300 MHz – 300 GHz) technologies. For instance, 5G communications demand smaller, better and cleverer (adaptive, reconfigurable, multi-role) microwave devices. New generation satellites desire lighter and flexible payloads. Hospitals and patients benefit greatly from wireless sensors for remote health monitoring, non-invasive diagnostics and treatments. Yi is working on:

Synthesis and application of novel multi-port filtering networks (MPFNs)
Integrated filter-antennas and other functional integration devices
Additive manufacturing
Microwave sensors

mm-Wave / THz devices for radars and communications
Terahertz (THz) wave is the spectrum between microwave and far-infrared light and relates to the frequencies from 300 GHz to 3 THz. It is also known as sub-millimetre wave. It is widely known that THz wave technology holds great promise for emerging industrial and scientific applications - security screening, remote sensing, non-destructive testing, material characterisation and communications. Because of immature device technologies, this part of the spectrum hasn’t been extensively utilised. The general objective of Yi’s research is to produce high-performance key components for future THz communication systems, metrology instruments and sensors. Most of these devices will be enabled by advanced micro/nano fabrication techniques. Yi is working on:

THz components and front-end systems
Micromachined passive circuits and antennas
Low loss THz waveguides and THz resonators
Frequency selective surfaces and metamaterials

A common theme of the research is to explore the use of novel design methods, new materials and advanced manufacturing techniques in microwave and terahertz devices.

airborne and satellite measurements of atmospheric composition (using a range of in situ and remote sensing techniques)Drone development for atmospheric sampling and remote sensingpollution transport and modelling (urban and regional, e.g. biomass burning sources)methane and other greenhouse gas emissions in the Arctic and UK - processes and inventories
Current Research Projects

My research interests focus on the use of airborne and satellite in situ and remote sensing data and transport modelling to interpret atmospheric chemical processes and composition budgets, especially those linked to air quality/urban pollution and greenhouse gases. Specific current (active) projects include:
Closing the Global Methane Budget (NERC - 2016-2020)
This NERC-funded project will use (and add to) a global dataset of greenhouse gas measurements - including surface monitoring stations, aircraft and satellites - to attempt to balance the sources and sinks of atmospheric methane in the Earth system. Methane (the second-most important greenhouse gas after CO2) is rising rapidly in the atmosphere and science does not fully understand the reasons why. The relative roles of fossil fuel emissions, wetland emissions, Arctic climate change and biogeochemical sinks must all be understood to close the ""budget"". This project will use vast datasets and state-of-the-science Earth system models to reconcile these factors and update our understanding of each source and sink term through tailored field work and the setup of new monitoring stations (especially in the Tropics). Grant's role in this project leads FAAM aircraft field projects  (www.faam.ac.uk) in Senegal, Uganda and Zambia to study regional source signatures of methane to help apportion and quanitfy fluxes of methane from different source types across the planet.
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for the measurement of CH4 (NERC - 2016-2017)
This 12-month NERC Technology Proof-of-concept project will seek to develop and test a new prototype drone for the remote sensing of methane and pioneer the use of 3D spatial tomography and rapid scanning techniqes to map methane plumes and quantify mass flux.
Environmental Baselining of potential locations of Hydraulic Fracturing (2015-2019)
This Department for Energy and Climate Change (now BEIS) funded project (see www.bgs.ac.uk/research/groundwater/shaleGas/monitoring/yorkshire.html) is an academically-led and independent project to understand the background environment of locations in Yorkshire and Lancashire ahead of any potential exploratory drilling for shale gas. My role in this project (together with colleagues at the University of York) is to lead the collection of a baseline dataset of atmopsheric composition (including greenhouse gases and air quality) at these two locations to provide a background against any future potential changes due to fracking in those areas can be interpreted and assessed.
NERC EQUIPT4RISK (2018-2022)
This strategic programme addresses the technological and measurement needs to better assess environmental impacts and risk associated with the development of shale gas extraction in the UK. Grant's involvement as the PI of a work package on atmospheric impacts consists of fieldwork and measurements to detect and quantify fugitive emissions of methane and greenhouse gases and air quality impacts.

Other researchDoctoral Thesis

Grant's PhD at Leicester University between 2001-2004 investigated the remote sensing of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) in the upper troposphere. It investigated the potential for the retrieval of PAN concentration data from remotely sensed infrared spectra of Earth’s atmosphere from atmospheric and space satellite platforms. The PAN molecule is an important atmospheric trace component, both in terms of its role as a reservoir molecule and intercontinental transport vehicle for urban pollution plumes; and through its impact on the ability of Earth’s atmosphere to cleanse itself of volatile organic pollutants. The first recorded laboratory reference spectra for PAN were measured as part of a CASE industrial partnership at the NERC Molecular Spectroscopy Facility (MSF). In conjunction with atmospheric radiative transfer modelling, these reference spectra were used to make the first measurements of PAN concentration data from infrared emission spectra of the Earth’s limb in the upper troposphere as measured by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) onboard ESA’s Envisat satellite. High concentrations of PAN were observed from space in convective outflow and frontal uplift of pollution plumes from megacities in China, with consequent implications for USA air quality downwind.
Previous Research Projects

GAUGE (2013-2017)
The GAUGE project (www.greenhouse-gases.org.uk/) addresses the need to validate the UK’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory reporting through top-down (measurement and modelling) approaches. My role in this project (as non-lead PI at Manchester and aircraft work package manager) will be to use measurements from the prestigious NERC FAAM aircraft (www.faam.ac.uk) to attempt to provide snapshots of closed-budget UK GHG emissions throughout several campaigns in 2014/2015.

Project Coordinator of the VOCALS-UK campaign. In the field, Grant planned aircraft science missions to study dynamical and microphysical influences on stratocumulus cloud formation and their representation in cloud-resolving, regional and climate models. Post-campaign interests involved a satellite and modelling analysis of trapped boundary layer gravity waves and their influence on convective processes in the South East Pacific (SEP), as well as atmospheric chemical and aerosol processing and composition statistical analysis from aircraft measurements and validation of local emissions inventories.
ACTIVE (Aerosol and Chemical Transport In tropical convection)
Darwin, Australia Nov 2005 –Feb 2006
Between 2005 and 2008, Grant worked as a researcher on the NERC-funded ACTIVE campaign. This campaign took place during the wet season in Darwin, Australia and employed two aircraft: the ARSF Dornier 228-101, and the Grob G520T Egrett aircraft operated by Airborne Research Australia. Fieldwork included flying as a mission scientist onboard the NERC Dornier-228 aircraft, the launch of stratospheric balloons measuring ozone and thermodynamic structure and data quality analysis for aircraft instrumentation. Post-campaign research included regional composition studies and relationships with local meteorology and climate, as well as the analysis of synoptic-scale dynamics and modulation of tropical deep convection.

Research interestsMy research is broadly concerned with understanding the role of interactions between plant and soil communities in regulating the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems, and their response to global change. A particular focus of my research is ecosystem nitrogen and carbon cycling and I work in a range of ecosystems, from tropical forests, to grasslands, and alpine and arctic tundra. Specific themes and examples of current research include:
Plant traits and ecosystem processes: A key goal of my research is to better understand of how plant traits impact on soil biological communities and the processes of carbon and nitrogen cycling that they drive. Much of this work is being done in grasslands, and includes studies done at the individual plant, field, and landscape scale. The ultimate aim of this research is to develop a trait-based framework for understanding how changes in plant functional diversity, for example resulting from land use change, influence soil microbial communities and the processes that underpin the ecosystem services of soil carbon storage and efficient nitrogen cycling. We are also using this knowledge to better manage grassland diversity for carbon storage.
Soil biodiversity and ecosystem function: Soil biological communities are extremely species rich and a key goal of my research, for several years, has been to better understand how changes in the diversity and composition of soil communities influence ecosystem processes. A key theme of this research is to advance understanding of how trophic interactions in soil control nutrient supply to plants, and how changes in food web composition impact on carbon and nitrogen cycling. This research also extends to understanding factors that regulate soil biodiversity at different spatial and temporal scales, and to optimising land management to reap benefits from the living soil.
Plant-soil interactions and climate change: Climate change impacts on biogeochemical cycles via a variety of mechanisms involving interactions between plant and belowground communities. My research is aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which climate change impacts on plant-soil interactions and the carbon cycle at different spatial and temporal scales, ranging from short term impacts on the physiology and activity of aboveground and belowground biota, to longer term impacts caused by changes in community composition. An ultimate goal is to use this research to inform on land management options for climate mitigation through the sequestration of carbon in soil.
Herbivore impacts on terrestrial ecosystems: An ongoing interest of mine, since my PhD, is the study of how large grazing animals influence the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems, with a focus on soil biological properties and nutrient cycling, and, more recently, carbon dynamics. Much of this work has been done in mountain grasslands that are grazed by sheep, but more recently we have been studying effects deer browsing in native forest ecosystems in the Scottish Highlands and reindeer in the high arctic.

Research interestsBiomolecular Archaeology
Our research uses DNA sequence analysis to answer archaeological questions. The projects involve analysis of both modern and preserved specimens, the latter studied by ancient DNA techniques, many of which have been developed at Manchester.
ADAPT – Life in a cold climate: the adaptation of cereals to new environments and the establishment of agriculture in Europe
This ERC project explores the concept of agricultural spread as analogous to enforced climate change and asks how cereals adapted to the new environments to which they were exposed when agriculture was introduced into Europe during the period 7000–4000 BC. The study material is a large collection of barley and wheat landraces (historic varieties) collected from different parts of Europe. The project combines genome sequencing and transcriptome profiling with ecological niche modelling to identify regions of Europe where early crops underwent evolutionary adaptation in response to local environmental conditions. We then compare these data with archaeological information, in order to understand whether pauses in the advance of agriculture were caused by the need for crops to undergo genetic adaptation to the new environments into which they were being taken, and whether further genetic adaptation was needed before crops became productive enough to support long term population growth. As well as providing a new dimension to our understanding of early European agriculture, the project also informs work on the impact that future environmental change could have on the sustainability of modern cereal cultivation.

EOA – Evolutionary origins of agriculture
We are partners in a second ERC project with the University of Sheffield. The overall aim is to improve understanding of the selective pressures acting on early crop domestication in Western Asia, combining elements of experimental plant ecology, molecular biology, archaeobotany and GIS analysis. In the Manchester part of the project we are using computer simulations to determine if the patterns of genetic diversity seen in landraces can reveal the order in which individual traits were selected by early farmers. In particular, we are investigating if the increase in seed size that accompanied domestication was to due to direct selection for this trait, or resulted from farmers selecting plants with a more vigorous growth habit.

Palaeodisease
Ancient DNA is an important tool in the study of disease in the past. Some pathogenic bacteria invade the bones and teeth, leaving traces of their DNA in the skeleton after death. By extracting and sequencing the bacterial DNA, it is possible to confirm the presence of a disease, and to study changes in the genetic features of the pathogenic bacteria. We are using next generation sequencing methods to obtain detailed genotypes and complete genome sequences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains responsible for tuberculosis in the past. We are particularly interested in linking strain variations to changes in TB virulence during the medieval period, when Britain became increasingly urbanised.
Genetic profiling of archaeological skeletons
Ancient DNA has considerable potential as a source of genetic data relating to the kinship affiliations of human skeletal remains, information that would enable archaeologists to make more accurate interpretations of social organisation at individual sites and across communities. Kinship data are impossible to obtain by conventional osteology but is attainable by genetic profiling. We are currently using ancient DNA to obtain information on kinship between groups of human burials from various sites in Britain and the rest of Europe.

Research interestsBone Biochemistry: Ancient and Degraded Proteins
Most of my research uses protein separation and analysis techniques, particularly 'soft-ionization' mass spectrometry, to investigate degradation in modern and ancient tissues ranging from processed foods to those found in archaeological and palaeontological burial environments. The 'soft-ionization' methods we typically use are Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) for high-throughput peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) of samples, and Electrospray Ionization (ESI), which we dedicate for more in-depth sequence analysis. It is the 'soft-ionization' that allows for the analysis of large biomolecules without inducing excessive fragmentation prior to analysis and detection in the mass spectrometer, ideal for studying low quantities of ancient and degraded proteins. We also now make inferences from our proteomics research to guide ancient DNA analyses for greater information in a more targetted manner.
Biomolecular Species Identification in Forensics and Archaeology
Despite early research into the survival of non-collagenous bone proteins such as the small mineral-binding protein osteocalcin, most of my research focuses on the dominant bone protein type 1 collagen because of its structural properties making it highly insoluble, resulting in enhanced survival. During my PhD I developed a method of 'fingerprinting' collagen peptides using a limited fractionation method that separated highly conserved collagen peptides from the more variable ones. Once I discovered that collagen fingerprinting could distinguish between the major domesticate animals used in animal husbandry, including the morphologically similar skeletal remains of sheep and goat, we named the technique ZooMS, after 'Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry'. In archaeological applications we typically use the species identifications to investigate likely animal husbanding practises in the past, where my research has mainly focused on early Near Eastern agriculture including work in Cyprus and south-east Turkey on samples >10,000 years old.
Palaeobiodiversity and Vertebrate Evolution
My current research uses high-throughput ZooMS to investigate how vertebrate biodiversity has changed in Britain over the past few million years, focusing on ~20,000 bone fragments excavated from deposits at the back of Pin Hole Cave, Derbyshire (in collaboration with Creswell Crags Heritage Centre and Manchester Museum) dating back approximately 50,000 years. I am also interested in the phylogenetic inferences we can make using protein sequencing, which have included working on ~650,000 year old mammoth remains from Britain, ~3.5 million year old giant camel fossils discovered in the High Arctic, as well as other more enigmatic species such as the dodo.

Research interestsThe use of bacteria in nano-manufacturing is an unexploited area of enormous potential which I am, as part of a larger research group, actively exploring. The behaviour of Fe(III)-reducing bacteria, a relatively newly discovered group of anaerobic microorganisms, offers a specific untapped resource for bio-nanotechnologies. These organisms can precipitate regular shaped nano-sized (20nm) crystals of the ferromagnetic ferrite spinel, magnetite (Fe3O4 ).  This process works by coupling the oxidation of organic matter to the reduction of Fe(III)-oxyhydroxides and is accomplished by direct contact between the terminal Fe(III) reductase in the bacteria and the mineral surface.  By controlling and manipulating this process of biomineral production, a low cost, low energy, environmentally friendly method of manufacture of nanoparticles can be developed to replace existing practices. Ferrite spinel nanoparticles (especially magnetite, Fe3O4, and related structures) are of great technological interest (e.g. in recording device materials) and we have succeeded in producing biogenic magnetites doped with Co, Ni, Mn and Zn that tune their electrical and magnetic properties; and we are currently developing up-scaling methodologies. Our focus is now on producing biogenic nanomagnetite-supported precious metal catalysts using  Pd, Pt, Au and Ag which are all catalytically active and highly conductive elements both individually and as alloys. Our aim is to produce a versatile group of novel magnetite nanomaterials with unique characteristics that can be customised to enhance their properties as catalysts, magnets, and electronic devices.

Research interests          My lab is interested in how things evolve. That is, how do differences in survivorship and reproduction lead to the vast array of patterns and behaviours that we see in nature? We approach this question using a combination of mathematical and computational models and empirical testing. Models are useful because they allow us to study complex processes like evolution, which are hard to understand, by combining simpler processes like reproduction, mutation, and selection, which are easier to understand and can be represented in a mathematical way. The results help us to gain a mechanistic understanding of biological evolution, and offer predictions that we can test in vivo.
          One of the advantages of mathematical modelling is that it has a low overhead. It is faster and cheaper to build a new mathematical model than it is to develop a new model system in the field or in the lab. As a result, research in my lab is not chained to a particular system or a particular question. I choose my research topics because they are interesting to me, and I encourage my students to do the same. Some of the broad topics we are currently interested in are:               
 

 
How do species evolve in response to human activity, and how does this affect the survival of populations and the stability of ecosystems?  Humans are changing the environment at unprecedented rates, and this will continue as our population and demand for resources grow. Understanding evolution in response to environmental change can help us to protect species, communities, and ecosystem services. My lab has studied how human activities influence macroevolutionary processes like speciation and extinction, and whether microevolution (i.e., adaptation) can protect populations and communities during environmental change. For example, we have shown that anthropogenic disturbances can disrupt speciation processes (Gilman and Behm 2011, Evolution), and that evolution can protect plant-pollinator mutualisms as global temperatures change (Gilman et al. 2012, Evolutionary Applications).
How and why does speciation occur? Speciation is an important source of biodiversity, and my lab aims to understand how speciation happens. We have used computational models to predict behavioral traits and mate choice systems that promote adaptive radiation (Gilman and Kozak 2015 Evolution). Working with collaborators, we have identified some of the traits we predicted in vivo in the rapidly speciating estrildid finch clade. Undergraduate students in my lab have used models to predict the conditions under which mate choice systems that promote speciation evolve (Chaffee et al. 2013 Evolution; Invernizzi and Gilman 2015 Current Zoology). We are now using experimental evolution in Drosophila to test these predictions.
How does environmental uncertainty affect the evolution of social behavior? My lab seeks to answer fundamental questions about how the environment contributes to the evolution of social behavior. We used models to predict that social learning is more likely to evolve in variable environments (Smolla et al. 2015 Proceedings B), and we have shown experimentally that Drosophila rely more heavily on public information when environments are variable. We have also used models to predict how the evolution of mate preferences depends on the environment (Gomez-Llano et al. 2016 Ecology and Evolution). We have recently begun testing this theory using humans as a model system.
          Mathematical models allow us to propose explanations for patterns we have observed in nature, and they can make predictions about patterns we have not yet seen. However, predictions are not endpoints in biology. Rather, predictions must be tested in the field or in the lab. In my own lab, we have studied evolved behaviours in Drosophila as well as in the charismatic European jumping spider Saitis barbipes. With collaborators, we have tested theory in birds, fish, and wolf spiders. We are always looking for new collaborators and new systems to study!

Research interestsExposure to environmental stresses, e.g. drought or low or high temperature, can have a damaging effect on plants, reducing the sucess of wild species and the productivity of crops. A common feature of most forms of abiotic stress is the production of reactive oxygen species, highly reactive molecules that can damage proteins, lipids and DNA. The aim of my research is to understand the pathways that lead to active oxygen production and how regulatory mechanisms can ameliorate that production. The particular emphasis is on the interaction between light and stress, and how light induces the production of reactive species.
In attempting to understand the mechanisms of regulation, we adopt a multi-disclipinary approach, combining state of the art spectroscopic and biochemical techniques with comparative studies in ecophysiology. We collaborate with colleages in Manchester and elsewhere in studies using metabolomics, proteomics and systems modelling.  Our research is focussing on the responses of plants to their environment on different time scales: 
In the short term, regulatory mechanisms eist that allow plants to control the capture of light and the flow of electrons to avoid production of reactive oxygen.  We were the firrst group to show evidence that plants operate a pathway of cyclic electron flow under steady state conditions.  This pathway is not widely excepted to be responsible to controlling the efficiency of light capture, through a process called non photochemical quenching.  At the same time, we have shown that the redox poise of the chloroplast plays an essential role in controlling electron transport.
Over longer timescales, plants are able to alter the composition of their cloroplasts to suit the prevailing conditions they experience.  We have identified a key transporter involved in signalling between the chloroplast and the nucleus and have shown that this signalling plays a major role in allowing plants to optimise their growth in natural environments, having a major impact on plant yields.

1 Lunar Meteorites


Lunar meteorites are fragments of rock that were thrown off the Moon when it was struck by an impacting body, and then entered an Earth crossing orbit. These rocks survived entry through the Earth’s atmosphere in a fireball, and landed on Earth as a meteorite. All lunar meteorites are collected as finds (i.e., to date no one has actually witnessed a lunar meteorite fireball fall event) in hot and cold desert environments where they have been preserved by low levels of precipitation and excess terrestrial weathering, and are relatively easy to identify from the local terrestrial environment.Most lunar meteorites have been found in Antarctica, Oman and in the deserts of North West Africa, and a few from deserts in Australia and Botswana. The first lunar meteorites Yamoto-791197 and Yamato-793169 were collected in Antarctica in 1979 by the Japanese meteorite hunting programme, although the first to be extensively studied as having a lunar origin was Allan Hills (ALHA) 81005, collected by the US meteorite hunting team in Antarctica in Jan. 1982. (n.b., meteorites are named after the closest named geographic feature or town).To date, there have been ~177 individual (named) lunar meteorite stones collected on Earth. Collectively this represents ~67 kg of lunar material (~18% of the mass returned by the Apollo and Luna missions).We know these samples are meteorites that came from the Moon using several lines of evidence (see here for more details): (i) a fusion crust initially identifies them as being a meteorite (this crust forms on the edge of a meteorite as it travels through the atmosphere); (ii) cosmogenic nuclide abundances and ratios (evidence of interaction with the space environment); and (iii) textural, chemical, mineralogical and isotopic similarity to Apollo and Luna samples  (see here for more details) distinguishes them from other meteorite classes.My research focuses on studying the mineralogy, chemistry and chronology (age) of lunar meteorite samples to investigation the geological evolution of the Moon. Details of my lunar meteorite research papers can be found on my publication page.

3 Lunar Meteorites Notes


***************************Statement regarding claims made by Mr Goran Lindfors: I studied a small fragment of material from Mr Lindfors. The data I collected demonstrated that the sample is texturally, mineralogically and chemically dissimilar to lunar materials and I relayed this information to him. I could not, therefore, support his attempts to seek to classify the sample as having lunar origin and I informed him of this. I understand that my name is now being used to support the sale of geological samples by Mr Lindfors that he is purporting as lunar meteorites. My testing did not support such a classification. Please also see http://meteorites.wustl.edu/meteorwrongs/m098.htm for further information about this material.

To understand evolution we use a range of tools, from computer models to model organisms, with a focus on experimental evolution. With these tools we ask questions at a range of evolutionary scales, from single mutations to comparisons among species.
 
Mutation rate plasticity
The probability that an organism’s offspring carry spontaneous changes to their DNA sequence depends on many things, including that organism’s environment. We are looking at environmentally dependent changes in mutation rate, or ‘mutation rate plasticity’. We discovered that microbes in dense populations tend to have lower mutation rates than microbes in spread out populations; that is, DAMP: density-associated mutation-rate plasticity. We want to understand DAMP from its mechanisms via how it evolves to the evolutionary effects that it has.

Anti-microbial landscapes
Organisms that are resistant to antibiotics and other anti-microbials are a major and growing issue in medicine and beyond. How this comes about is a question of evolution and we are looking for evolutionary answers. This involves considering the whole ‘landscape’ of organisms’ possible genetic make-ups and their ability to thrive with or without antibiotics. Collaboratively, we are also looking at complete landscapes of anti-microbial peptides and their ability kill particular organisms.

Genotype-phenotype map in evolution
How do the individual DNA changes used by evolution (genotype) affect the behaviour of the complex system that is the living cell (phenotype)? How do organisms manage to evolve at all when even a small genetic change may affect many different aspects of the cellular system? How do the changes to genotype and phenotype used by short-term evolution relate to the changes seen across longer-term evolution, within or among species? We want to answer such questions using a combination of wet-lab and computational approaches.

Research interestsI work very closely with colleagues in other Schools of the University of Manchester, and also elsewhere. I work in several diverse areas, including-Microbial transformations of radionuclidesMicroorganisms can alter local geochemical conditions through redox processes, changes in pH or production of complexants. These can have major effects on trace element and radionuclide behaviour, and we focus our efforts on trying to understand the mechanisms by which these transformations occur. Colonization and transformation of depleted U/Ti alloy (DU), used in anti-armour munitions, by the ericoid mycorrhizal fungus Hymenoscyphus ericae after three months. The cord-like aggregated hyphae interact with black DU decomposition products and the intensity of the yellow colouration of mycelial cords increased with exposure time. Data and images from Dr M. Fomina, University of Dundee.Mineral surface reactions The interaction of radionuclides in solution with mineral surfaces is an important control on their environmental mobility. Understanding the mechanisms of these reactions is essential if we are to make credible predictions of radionuclide mobility, but this requires the use of a wide range of imaging (e.g. electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy) and spectroscopic techniques (e.e. X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectroscopies) to gain as much information as possible. Scanning electron microscope image of becquerelite, Ca[(UO2)3O2(OH)3]2.8H2O, crystallites formed by reaction of UO22+ in solution with the surface of plagioclase feldspar.Radionuclides in the 'real' environment The natural environment is very complex and heterogeneous, and radionuclides are typically present at concentrations below 10-12 g g-1. It is therefore very difficult even to measure concentrations in different components, and even more difficult to develop an understanding of the processes which are operating. These studies require the development of techniques for quantifying radionuclides in quantities as small as 1000 atoms, and the ability to measure a range of element and isotope ratios in order to fingerprint different sources. The 241Pu distribution down the profile of an intertidal sediment from the NE Irish Sea (in red; bottom and left axes) mirrors the historical discharges from Sellafield (in blue; top and right axes).

Reactions of sand and dust in jet engines
Every year, millions of tonnes of dust is carried up into the atmosphere, mainly during sand and dust storms. This dust presents a major hazard to modern aircraft engines, which operate at extremely high temperatures that are close to the melting points of many of the minerals in the dust. Particles entrained into the air intake of a turbine engine may be heated to temperatures of well over 1200 °C. If they melt they may clog up the cooling holes in the turbine blades or react with the blade material and cause various degrees of engine damage, leading to a shortened service life of the engine, and potentially engine failure. It is recognised by the aviation industry that this hazard is likely to get worse as future climatic variability and extremes result in an expansion of dusty environments, as well as more frequent and severe sand and dust storms.  At the same time, engine operating temperatures are likely to be higher in the future than they are today. The multidisciplinary DUST research group at the University of Manchester is engaged in a variety of research projects, investigating the impact of airborne dust on aircraft engines at all stages of its passage through the engine, from the characterisation of atmospheric particles entering the engine, their fractionation and fragmentation in the cold section of the engine, through to their deposition and melting in the hot section. We study these using numerical modelling, a variety of experimental approaches, and by analysing real deposits, both from on-wing engines and produced in engine tests.
Halogen partitioning between mantle phases and melts
The halogens are useful tracers of volatile processes in the Earth. We have measured the partitioning of F, Cl and Br between mantle phases and silicate melts at P-T conditions relevant to peridotite melting in the Earth, using a piston-cylinder apparatus for the high-P experiments. Halogen concentrations were determined by TOF-SIMS and noble gas methods in the Isotope Geochemistry Laboratories in Manchester. Within the range of the P-T conditions investigated, halogen partitioning shows a strong temperature dependence but little pressure dependence.
The stability of hydrous minerals and carbonates in subduction zones
A knowledge of the stability of hydrous phases and carbonates at high pressure and low to moderate temperature is necessary to understand the role that H2O and CO2 play in subduction zone processes. Some hydrous phases transport H2O from shallow depths to the source of arc magmatism, e.g. chlorite and antigorite; others only form as the lower-pressure minerals break down, and these may return H2O deep into the Earth’s mantle, e.g. 10-Å phase. Carbonates are stable over a wide P-T range, with double carbonates stable at shallower depths breaking down to single carbonates during subduction. We have used phase-equilibrium experiments to study the stabilities of these and other subduction zone minerals. Not only do the pure phases show a wide range of stabilities, but the effect of solid solution, e.g. Mg ↔ Fe in 10-Å phase, can be considerable.
Crystal chemistry of high-pressure phases
A knowledge of the crystal chemistry of high-P phases under ambient conditions and at high pressures and temperatures is essential for understanding the mechanisms for their stabilisation in the Earth’s mantle. Detailed characterisation of the 10-Å phase has shown it to have a much more complex composition and structure than previously thought. This has implications for the amount of water it can contain, and the extent of its P-T stability in the Earth. Other phases that we have studied include Ge-pyroxenes and the sodic amphibole eckermannite.

	Stress responses in algae and plants

	Algae and plants are frequently exposed to abiotic stresses such salt stress, toxic metal stress or nutrient deficiency stress. These organisms have sophisticated mechanisms to respond and adapt to these stresses. Unicellular green algae such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are ideal model systems to study stress responses in a photosynthetic organism at the single cell level. We are also using plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana as good models to study responses to stress, in particular Ca2+ signal responses.

	1. Stress-mediated calcium homeostasis
	A long standing research interest is involved in identifying the role of Ca2+ efflux transporters (Ca2+/H+ exchangers and Ca2+-ATPases) in regulating calcium nutrition and in generating Ca2+ signals in response to environmental stresses such as salt stress, drought or cold in Arabidopsis and in Chlamydomonas. Furthermore we are elucidating the mechanisms by which these transporters are regulated.

	2. Cadmium tolerance in Chlamydomonas
	Work in our lab has recently begun to look at some of the responses to cadmium and mechanisms for cadmium transport and tolerance in Chlamydomonas. This may have applications for the use of algae in metal-contaminated waste water bioremediation.

	3. Responses to nutrient deficiency
	We are examining some of the molecular and metabolic responses to nutrient deficiency including changes to the cell's elemental composition and the impact on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.

	 

	Biofuel generation from microalgae

	 

	Microalgae are a diverse group of photosynthetic freshwater or marine organisms which have potential applications in sustainable biotechnology such as for providing renewable energy resources. We are investigating the potential of microalgae as a sustainable resource for producing biofuel.

	1. Lipid productivity in algae
	We are performing research to understand and enhance lipid accumulation in freshwater and marine algae utilising molecular biology, gene expression, metabolic and physiological analysis.

	2. Potential of algae cultivation on wastewater
	Algae have a potential dual use application on wastewater for the efficient removal of excess nitrogenous and phosphate pollutants and as a cultivation medium for biomass or biofuel generation. We are examining the characteristics of microalgae on wastewater.

	 

	Cation transport and homeostasis in plants

	 

	Plants have an essential requirement for many metals for normal growth and development, however, these metals can be toxic when present in excess. Non-essential, toxic metals such as cadmium can also be accumulated by plants. Plants must therefore carefully regulate their metal content. A wide variety of metal transporters are responsible for regulating the accumulation and partitioning of these metals throughout the cell.

	1. Manganese transport and homeostasis
	We are interested in the role of metal transporters in transition metal homeostasis and metal tolerance, focusing particularly on manganese. Such work can increase our understanding of how plants tolerate and respond to metal stress, which can be a major limiting factor to agricultural productivity.

Phylogeny and the fossil record
	In order to make evolutionary sense of fossils, we need to accurately place them in the tree-of-life and consider how they are related to living organisms. The type of information that fossil organisms provide is, however, very different from that of their living counter-parts. Do the fundamental taphonomic processes of death, decay and preservation involved in fossil formation limit our ability to accurately place fossils in the tree-of-life? When we take these sorts of filters into account, do they change our understanding of the origins of groups and the nature of evolutionary processes, and if so, how can we correct for them?



Experimental decomposition and taphonomic biases
	Many of the most important episodes in the history of life, such as the Cambrian explosion, preceded the evolution of hard-tissues (e.g. skeletons or shells). Rare, exceptionally preserved fossils of completely soft-bodied organisms are therefore critical for reconstructing these events. Given the ephemeral nature of soft-tissues, these fossils are unfortunately not pristine representations, but collapsed and decomposed remains. Decay is a fundamental and inevitable part of the formation of these fossils, and as such, experimentally identifying sequences of decay can shed new light on their formation and evolutionary significance. In my lab, sequences of morphological decay are identified using modern proxies in order to unlock important taphonomic biases. The data provided can transform our interpretation of the anatomy and evolutionary significance of key fossils and subsequently reshape our understanding of evolutionary events.

	 



	 

The origin and early evolution of vertebrates
	The origin and early evolution of vertebrates represents an episode of massive genetic, morphological and embryological changes – one of the most fundamental in metazoan history. The fossil record provides crucial insight into the timing and nature of morphological changes taking place, both before and after the evolution of skeleton. Through taphonomic analyses and application of decay data, our understanding of the origin of vertebrates is transformed. Furthermore, analyses of the taxonomy, diversity and phylogeny of fossil jawless fishes provide a framework our understanding of the origin and evolution of jawed fishes, an important stage of our own evolutionary history.

Research interestsBackgroundI am a computational zoologist interested in the use of numerical and robotic techniques for investigating comparative anatomy, fossil behaviour and biomechanics. I have a background in human and comparative functional anatomy, and scientific industrial experience in image analysis and computer modelling.Current ResearchMy primary interest is in the evolution of the locomotor system and I am currently working on the mechanics and control of velocity change (starting, stopping and turning) which involves both experimental biomechanics and computer modelling in a range of organisms (humans, non-human primates, birds, dinosaurs, turtles and spiders). I am also working on several non-locomotor biomechanics project including hand use and breathing mechanics. I have developed a number of novel computational approaches to investigate animal mechanics including video based 3D photogrammetry and multibody dynamic models in a high performance computing context. I am also working on multidimensional image processing to enable better visualisation of multi-spectral images using optical and other information sources. This has applications in reading ancient manuscripts and visualising the chemical signatures of fossilised soft tissues revealed using synchrotron x-ray fluorescence.

Research interests
	My current research interests focus on the evolution of behavioural complexity and flexibility with the goal of understanding the adaptive benefits and evolutionary pathways driving evolutionary changes in cognitive architecture. The objective of the research is to understand what makes primate sociality distinct from other taxa and why and how humans have been able to develop large complex societies. There are several parallel themes to our research program.

	The first is investigating evolutionary trends in brain size and architecture. Despite brain tissue being metabolically costly, relative brain size has increased over evolutionary time across mammalian taxa. Using a comparative approach, we test explicit adaptive hypotheses for the evolution of brain size and architecture. We have demonstrated that sociality is universally associated with large brains in mammals, but the relationship is strongest for primates (Shultz and Dunbar 2007; Perez-Barberia, Shultz, Dunbar 2007).This research has focused on a number of vertebrate taxa, including birds (Shultz and Dunbar 2010d; Shultz et al 2005) and primates (Shultz and Dunbar 2010b). We have provided the first quantitative test for encephalisation in mammals (Shultz and Dunbar 2010a). Most recently we have applied the approaches developed in other animals to understand hominin brain and cognitive evolution (Shultz et al, in press).

	The second theme is to develop and use network theory to evaluate social complexity through measures of stability and structuring in animal populations (Stanley and Shultz, in press). We are currently developing this approach by assessing responses across ecological gradients. Equids are the current model system, due to the availability of data across wide ecological gradients, but the objective is to extend these analyses to evaluate variation and flexibility in primate network structure.

	The third theme is to identify macroevolutionary trends in social behaviour using Bayesian statistics. Recent work involves reconstructing major evolutionary transitions in primate sociality and testing alternative models of social evolution (Shultz et al, 2011). We are now using this approach address questions about the evolution of mating systems in primates, and the distribution of marriage and kinship systems across human populations.

Finally, I am supervising projects that evaluate how species characteristics affect their sensitivity to environmental change (Salido-Grana et al, 2011).

Research interestsMy research interests focus on building computational models of atmospheric aerosol particles for use in interpretation of measured properties and as sub models for incorporation into climate change models. This broad classification masks a hierarchy of models and techniques with greatly varying complexity and range of applicability.  In addition, the research area is highly multi-disciplinary, covering: Physics, Chemistry, Numerical methods and Computational Science.
Aerosol particles are ubiquitous components in the atmosphere. Ranging from a few nanometres to microns in size, they are comprised of potentially thousands of chemical components, their size and composition key determinants in their environmental impacts. They remain one of the most uncertain contributors to climate change:directly influencing the radiative flux by scattering/absorbing radiation and indirectly through their ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei (without aerosol particles there would be no clouds!). I use a wide range of holistic approaches to attempt reduction of these uncertainties:
At the single particle level, highly detailed theoretical tools have been developed to gain further understanding on the link between the chemical nature of organic aerosol, its interaction with inorganic components, and the associated impact on aerosol and cloud properties.  The partitioning of material between the gaseous and condensed phase is key to determining the evolving chemical composition and size, thus environmental impacts. In addition to detailed modeling studies, I use laboratory studies to validate and improve methods for predicting fundmanetal properties such as pure component vapour pressures (e.g. see our current project webpage  ).  These studies offer insights into the applicability of methods, largely designed for chemical engineering purposes, for use in atmospheric studies.In addition to the detailed studies mentioned above, the highly complex modelling tools are also used to drive process parameterisation in large scale models. These large scale models demand numerical and chemical complexity be kept to a minimum.  This presents a new challenge to those listed above as the trade-off between accuracy and numerical becomes paramount. Without a retention of significant accuracy there is a danger of erroneously prescribing confidence to the effect of certain detailed phenomena on large scale effects such as climate change and air quality.Leveraging novel and well establsihed technologies to aid the broad areas listed above is critical. I currently manage development of novel informatics tools to provide online community facilities. Alongside traditional multi-core CPU approaches, graphics cards (GPUs) with thousands of cores have become available as 'accelerators' for compute-intensive work which we are currently begining to probe for environmental models.

Research interestsResponse of invertebrates to metal pollution
My research has two inter-related strands. The first is an examination of the impact of trace metals at the individual and ecosystem level. We have recently shown that aluminium present in polluted waters modifies behaviour in the pond snail Lymnaea. Future work will look for neurophysiological changes and be extended to other sub-lethal measures of potential damage such as a decrease in immuno-competence. My studies at the ecosystem level have centred on an examination of the impact of pollution from mining and mine wastes. In collaboration with geochemists and hydrologists I am looking at changes in community structure in relation to shifts in metal concentrations arising from hydrometeorlogical events. This work is focusing on a catchment in Anglesey whose small size lends itself to intensive study. These investigations have been extended to sites on the Isle of Man and Greece.
The second theme in my work examines how organisms accumulate trace metals and the role of certain organs in detoxifying the absorbed metals. Studies with aluminium are particularly interesting, as we have shown that the metal is accumulated to a high degree by aquatic gastropods and crustacea at pH values where it was thought to be relatively unavailable. I have continued my interest in the response of invertebrates to pollution by metals with an examination of intrinsic and extrinsic influences on metal uptake in relation to their use as monitors.
More recently I have also become interested in the hydrography and ecology of waterbodies recovering from pollution. Redeveloped docks and canals, in particular, provide ideal sites to examine the process of ecological change and recovery. The need to manage such systems also provides opportunities to assess the impact of habitat manipulation and hydrographic changes on the ecology. Of particular interest is the control of phytoplankton by filter-feeding bivalves and exudates from barley straw. My work in this area centres around an examination of estuarine and freshwater docks and waterways.

Research interests

The core theme of my research is the measurement of atmospheric aerosols. Particulate matter is produced from both natural and anthropogenic sources and is known to have significant effects on both health and climate. However, the processes governing their lifecycle and effects are poorly understood, which hampers our predictive capability of them and their impacts. These are some examples of areas of research in which I am actively involved.
Urban aerosols. As part of major collaborative projects, I have studied particulates (principally PM1) in urban environments and worked to identify and quantify specific sources, such as traffic emissions, cooking, domestic burning, secondary aerosol formation and regional transport, and investigate the factors governing their concentrations.
Secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Secondary aerosols from both biogenically and anthropogenically emitted organic gases can form a very large fraction of the submicron aerosol mass but it still relatively poorly understood and represented by models. I have conducted measurements in a variety of locations including urban, rural, boreal forests and tropical rainforests and found a range of different processes and behaviours at play. These measurements are used in conjunction with laboratory work to develop process and large-scale models.
Black carbon (BC). As well as having potential impacts on human health, BC (soot) is known to be a strong absorber of radiation, having a short-lived warming effect on climate, particularly on local scales. However, the addition of secondary material can significantly alter its optical properties, lifetime and thus impacts. Quantifying these processes requires a combination of measurements to quantify an aerosol’s BC content and properties on a variety of different spatial scales since emission, which can then be used to develop models used to represent the key properties.




Measurement Techniques


A large aspect of my work is the application of specialist aerosol instrumentation, mainly with those that utilise in situ analysis during intensive measurements.
Aerosol Mass Spectrometry. Much of my work has focused on the development and application of the Aerodyne Research Inc (ARI) Aerosol Mass spectrometer (AMS). The Centre for Atmospheric Science currently has three instruments based around Tofwerk Time-Of-Flight (TOF) mass spectrometers; two Compact (C-TOF) and one High Resolution (HR-TOF) versions. One of the C-TOF instruments is mainly used for airborne measurements on the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM). This instrument is designed for the online analysis of aerosol composition through thermal desorption and analysis with Electron Ionisation (EI). This is able to study matter from particles smaller than 1 µm in size and produces data on ammonium, nitrate, sulphate, chloride and organic matter, which in most environments represents the majority of particulate matter in this size range.
Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF). This is a multivariate technique frequently applied to environment data, designed to separate complex datasets into a number of discrete ‘factors’. When applied to AMS data, this can be used to quantitatively estimate the sources of particulate organic matter present. Examples include traffic, domestic burning, cooking and secondary processes. This technique continues to offer new insights into the sources and processes of aerosols in the atmosphere and is particularly powerful when used in conjunction with other gas and particle phase measurements.
Single Particle Soot Photometry. The Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) by Droplet Measurement Technologies (DMT) is an instrument designed to study BC on a particle-by-particle basis. The aerosol is passed through the active cavity of a Nd:YAG laser, where particles that contain BC absorb the laser energy and vaporise. The BC is quantified by measuring the intensity of the incandescent light emitted when a particle vaporises and the overall size is indicated by the amount of light scattered by the particle (note that particles that do not contain BC will still scatter light). This information is highly useful when studying the complex BC processes in the atmosphere.
Other techniques. Others include the DMT  Photoacoustic Soot Spectrometer (PASS), which measures bulk light absorption by converting a modulated laser beam to sound in an acoustic. The ARI Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift (CAPS) is a new technique used to absolutely quantify the total aerosol extinction (light scattering plus absorption) by measuring the phase shift of modulated LED light through an optical cavity. The ARI/DMT SP-AMS is a new variant of the AMS, which uses an active cavity laser identical to that used in the SP2 to vaporise particles, thereby studying the composition of BC and its coatings.

Research interestsMy research focuses on using the RELAX mass spectrometer to analyse xenon isotope ratios in a variety of solar system materials.
RELAX (Refrigerator Enhanced Laser Analyser for Xenon) is an ultra sensitive, time of flight, resonance ionisation mass spectrometer specifically for measuring xenon isotope ratios. RELAX combines
a resonance ionisation source,a cryogenic sample concentrator anda time of flight mass spectrometer.
It is the most sensitive, and lowest blank, instrument currently available for determination of xenon isotope ratios - the detection limit is 950 atoms132Xe, and is limitedonly by variation in the blank, which is currently ~1000 atoms 132Xe. At peak sensitivity sample sizes are restricted to ~106atoms. Repeat analyses of air calibration samples are reproducible, allowing precise and accurate isotope ratios to be determined by averaging multiple analyses.
Xenon isotope measurement made using RELAX had contributed to our understanding of a range of issues relating to the evolution of our solar system.
Most recently my research has focused on analysing material returned by NASA's Genesis missions. We have successfully extracted solar wind xenon from silicon collector targets which flew onboard the Genesis spacecraft, and determined the xenon concentration and isotopic composition.
I am also interested in a wide range of other samples which can be analysed using RELAX, including:
Analysis of individual hadean zircons to constrain the Pu/U ratio of the early solar system.Analysis of individual lunar zirconsInvestigationf of Xe concentrations of IDPs, which suggest the concentration may had a significantly lower upper limit than previously reported.We have attempted Xe analysis of individual SiC grains.I-Xe dating of a wide range of meteorites, including material of different metamorphic grades from Rumuruti chondrites to investigate whether there is a link between the time of clousre to Xe-loss and the extend of metamorphism on the R-chindrite parent body.Comparing the I-Xe systematics in anomalous eucrites to that in ""normal"" eucrites.
We are currently working towards attempting xenon analysis of cometary material collected and returned to earth by NASA's Stardust mission. The aerogel used to collect the cometary particles has a large Xe blank that would swamp any embedded cometary Xe, therefore we are in the process of combining closed system step etching (CSSE) with RELAX to attempt to separate the xenon in the aerogel from that in the cometary material.

Research interestsMy research focuses on the non-invasive study of mummified animal remains from ancient Egypt. I lead a project which reunites archaeological remains in museums around the world to enable the cross-examination of a large and varied dataset. Through the project, known as the Ancient Egyptian Animal Bio Bank, a programme of radiographic analysis (X-ray and CT scanning) of mummified animal remains is conducted in collaboration with partners in the NHS, private healthcare providers and veterinarians, to obtain high-quality imaging data revealing the contents of linen-wrapped mummies. Identification of taxa through radiography alone can be problematic, particularly in the case of incomplete bodies or fragmented remains, both of which are commonplace in material of this nature. I am currently developing a protocol for mummy investigation using enhanced imaging modalities and computer visualisation techniques, combined with 3D printing to replicate anomalous material contained within mummies, thereby enabling more accurate identification. Improving our ability to correctly identify material within animal mummies in turn enables a more comprehensive understanding of their role within the social and religious framework of ancient Egypt.

Egyptology lends itself nicely to public engagement and always proves very popular with the media, creating many opportunities to disseminate my research to a wide audience. I worked with the BBC to develop and film a documentary for Horizon based on animal mummies in 2015, and I have been interviewed on Channel 4’s Sunday Brunch and the BBC’s Newsround. I curated an award-winning touring exhibition entitled 'Gifts for the Gods: Animal Mummies Revealed' which opened in Manchester in October 2015. The exhibition then toured to the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow, World Museum Liverpool, Museum of Wigan Life, the National Trust’s Lyme Park, and is due to be displayed at the National History Museum in Tring during 2020. Alongside the project team, I won the University of Manchester’s Making a Difference Award for Outstanding Public Engagement Initiative in 2016 for the exhibition and the associated outreach events.
I run a programme of experimental mummification using donated animal cadavers all belonging to taxa commonly found mummified and using ingredients identified through analysis of small samples recovered from damaged mummies. The results of the radiographic analysis of ancient mummies are used to inform the experimental design, with radiography used to document changes to the cadaver during mummification and desiccation. To date, 23 animals have been mummified in our lab and all continue to remain in a stable state.
I am privileged to have been involved in the scientific investigation of a number of mummified human bodies throughout my time at Manchester, including 18 mummies from the University collection. I am director of two research projects to investigate mummies from museums in Perth and Paisley, Scotland. Working on both human and animal remains enables the comparison of both mummy types highlighting potential similarities and differences, and identifying trends in the chronology and geographic distribution of mummification techniques and decorative styles.

Research interestsThe main focus of my research is on biotic interactions between plants. I am particularly interested in the role of root exudates and soil microbes in mediating plant-plant interactions and in establishing how the nature of plant responses to neighbours is affected by the evolutionary history of the species involved in the interaction. My research has included studies of individual plants from single species; multiple plant species, with the aim of explaining interspecific variation in various traits; and entire plant communities. I‘m currently working towards incorporating an ecosystem perspective in my research.
Here are some themes I am currently interested in:
Local adaptation, plant co-existence and belowground interactions
My current research focuses on belowground plant interactions and particularly the role of evolutionary history and the mechanisms mediating interactions. Studies on the ability of plant roots to detect and distinguish between neighbours of different identities have revealed very complex and species-specific interactions. While some root responses to neighbours may be mediated by nutrients, the results of several studies have indicated the involvement of non-nutritional cues.  The interactions are likely to be mediated by root exudates, which may affect plant growth and performance either directly or by altering soil properties and interactions with microbial communities. Also, very little is known about the role of local adaptation in determining the nature and specificity of root interactions. I use artificial grassland communities and manipulate belowground processes to determine the role of local adaptation, root exudates and soil microbes in plant community structuring and ecosystem functioning.
 
Kin recognition: patterns, mechanisms and consequences
Recent studies found that plants are able to detect the genetic identity of their neighbours. Some species proliferate roots when grown next to unrelated individuals but apparently avoid direct competition with kin by reducing root growth. Kin recognition ability in plants may have important implications for the functioning of natural ecosystems and it also opens up new possibilities in crop breeding. However, in-depth knowledge is required to estimate the importance of this phenomenon in natural systems and to realise its potential in agricultural science. In my work, I am looking at the commonness of this phenomenon in plant kingdom, the role of root exudates as mediators in kin recognition and the consequences of recognition for plant interactions with other ecosystem components.
 
Evolutionary theory and species traits
An increasing number of studies use trait-based approach to predict plant community and ecosystem functioning. However, there is surprisingly little understanding of how measurable plant traits, particularly those related to belowground processes, translate into plant function and what are the evolutionary mechanisms shaping these traits. By looking at plants from the perspective of evolutionary game theory, I try to identify belowground traits that enable suppression or avoidance of competitors reminiscent of selfish or cooperative behaviour, respectively, and how these traits are shaped by species life history.
 
Phenotypic plasticity
Phenotypic plasticity is an ability of organisms to modify their phenotype in response to environmental cues. This property is fundamentally important for the survival of life in variable or rapidly changing environments. I have carried out a number of projects exploring morphological plasticity of plants to different light cues, plant growth facilitation by shading and the role of species habitat requirements and community spatial patterns in shaping plasticity.

My background has run the gamut of Social Sciences, HCI, Science and Technology Studies, Media and Cultural Studies and Surveillance Studies; all intersecting via projects on digital media technologies and/or sustainabilities of various sorts. My earliest PhD research was an international multi-sited ethnography of virtual reality technologies exploring issues in embodiment, identity, organisation and discourse – across the three domains of popular entertainment, arts, and digital-DIY/ experimentation. This was followed by various UK-based research projects focussed on mobile devices and everyday mobilities – addressing issues including everything from mass mobile consumption and the early emergence of normative everyday usage practices [ESRC, Mobile Providers, BT], through to the organisation and regulation of mobile data [Intel] and the informational policy challenges presented by the generation and use of such mobile-generated data – including dimensions of trust, risk and privacy. A little later I was involved in projects centred on Sustainabilities more explicitly – including the RESOLVE project via the Centre for Environmental Strategy at the University of Surrey, and UK/NZ Sustainability research exchanges via the British Academy.

My expertise is in biogeochemistry, soil sciences, and analytical method development, and I am interested in urban agriculture, carbon abatement technologies, and energy biosciences.
Other Expertise
I studied Agricultural and Environmental Science, and specialised in pesticide behaviour in soils during my PhD. I developed and validated extraction (SPE, SFE, ASE) and analytical methodologies (GC-FID/NPD, HPLC-DAD) to assess sorption and degradation of pesticides in soil. During my postdoctoral research, I have developed a novel mass spectrometer-thermal balance system (TA-IRMS) for the simultaneous determination of C and O stable isotope, gas analysis, mass balance and energy change for volatile minerals and soil carbon materials. The novel characterisation of Carbon pools by TG-DSC-QMS-IRMS provides fundamental information to model C turnover in soils and sediments. The development of the TA-IRMS system meant the need of well characterised samples to test the system. This enabled us to establish collaborations nationally and internationally. I have also used a range of analytical techniques (analytical flash pyrolysis with combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), 13C-NMR, and TG-DSC-QMS) to characterise and quantify refractory organic matter such as black carbon and charcoal in soil.
Current Work

My current
research focus on ‘Urban Agrifood systems: developing
guidelines for future research’ and
investigating potential of artificial urban soils to storage and capture carbon. 

In this and
similar projects we use a multidisciplinary approach to fully understand
biofuel production from biomass (including organic waste), and
biogeochemical processes taking place in the environment and their implications
to C and N cycles, carbon sequestration, CO2 mitigation, soil erosion, and
ultimately, climate change.

Atmospheric processing affects the current and future composition of our atmosphere, and impacts upon human and environmental health, air quality and climate.  My research group addresses areas of atmospheric chemistry and clean air science, including
 
- Understanding the sources and transformations of air pollutants such as Particulate Matter and Nitrogen Dioxide in the urban atmosphere, ranging from the UK to developing megacities such as Delhi
- Quantifying the sources and sinks for atmospheric oxidants: Impacts upon urban air quality and tropospheric composition from new processes such as the formation of Criegee Intermediates, HONO and particulate-mediated renoxification
- Applying air pollution science to improve local and regional air quality policy measures, to ensure these can most effectively and efficiently improve human and environmental health
 
Work in the group combines atmospheric field measurements, simulation chamber and laboratory studies and numerical modelling approaches; we currently have an emphasis upon developing new integrated approaches to assess chemical processing (a complement to the traditional focus upon species abundance).​
 
While we are aiming to achieve fundamental understanding of the atmospheric chemical system, our work also takes place in an applied context: providing the knowledge to underpin policy development to alleviate air pollution.

The overall goal of her research is to unravel the complex interplay between life and climate ranging from the modern day back through millions of years. Much of her research to date has focused on constraining climatic and biotic (e.g., ecological and evolutionary) responses to short-lived environmental perturbations over the past 65 million years of Earth’s history. Focal events include the transient global warming event, the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) ~40 million years ago and other ‘hyperthermals’. The geochemistry of foraminiferal tests is one of the main means used to reconstruct both fossil foraminifera ecology and past environments. As such she is actively involved in evaluating the fidelity of key geochemical proxies (e.g., d11B, d13C and d18O values) in fossil and modern foraminiferal carbonate with the view to improving confidence in our palaeoreconstructions.
Kirsty’s research interests at a glance are:
1) Biotic responses and sensitivity to environmental change in our past, present and future oceans
2) Cenozoic (particularly Eocene) environmental change
3) The fidelity of geochemical and biotic proxies for reconstructing past ecology and environments

Steven is an interdisciplinary environmental researcher with a broad interest in human-environment relations. His work is informed by rural geography, social anthropology and rural sociology and focuses on the relationship between sociocultural values and environmental practices, interventions, policies and governance. He has applied this approach most especially to the study of agriculture, having conducted extended ethnographic fieldwork with British hill farmers.
More specifically his research focuses on:
Farming cultureThe uptake and receptivity of farmers to agri-environmental schemes (AES)The applications of rhetoric culture theoryTheorising and better understanding processes of cultural change in the face of environmental, economic and political uncertaintyUnderstanding and demonstrating the complex relationship between cultural values, environmental practices and social resilienceExploring the relationship between cultural values, personhood, places and practicesProcesses of environmental decision-making, governance and conflict managementIdeology, power and agency in environmental contexts

David is Professor of Hydrology in the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences and Director of Research of the College of Life and Environmental Sciences. He is Chair-holder for the UNESCO Chair in Water Sciences at the University of Birmingham. 
His research is interdisciplinary, focusing on three complementary themes within hydroclimatology (interface between hydrology-climatology): (1) climate and river flow regimes; (2) hydro-climatological processes within alpine, Arctic, mountain and glacierized river basins; and (3) river energy budget and water temperaturedynamics. He has a crosscutting interest in ecohydrology/ hydroecology, specifically ecological response to hydro-climatological and physico-chemical habitat variability/ change. He also develops new methods for monitoring, analysing and modelling environmental dynamics at a range of space-time scales. His research has significant blue skies and applied implications for understanding and responding to impacts of climate change/ variability on hydrological systems and riverine ecology, and the management/ conservation of freshwaters.
David is active in UNESCO’s International Hydrology Programme, UK Representative for the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (until 2016), and Vice-President of the IAHS-International Commission for Surface Water. Beyond academia, he provides advice to Government, agencies, water industry and regulators (please see Other activities).

ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2050-3989Scopus Author ID: 55973774400
Dr Kama’s doctoral and postdoctoral research has developed nascent scholary interests in 'resource-making' practices, including the contentious scientific practices, economic interventions and political struggles through which new components of the material world are rendered feasible for exploration and production. The empirical focus of this research has been on unconventional fossil fuels, but also on non-energy materials and wastes.
Her DPhil thesis, entitled 'Unconventional Futures: Anticipation, Materiality, and the Market in Oil Shale Development' offers one of the first scholarly arguments for a relational and processual account of 'resource materialities' and anticipatory energy economies. It is based on a detailed analysis of how oil shale exploitation is perpetuated through the promise of future prosperity, standardised across disparate geo-economic environments, and subsequently transforms the carbon economy and politics.
Her current ESRC-funded research project, 'Geo-logics and Geo-politics: The Collective Governance of European Shale Gas Development' (£149,196) explores the geoscientific disputes and geopolitical struggles arising from the recent uptake of ‘fracking’ in EU countries. This research accounts for the epistemologically and politically transformative potential of resource-making controversies in reconfiguring expert knowledge production, science-policy relations and forms of public activism around extractive economies.
Dr Kama’s wider research is concerned with the nascent field of ‘political geology’, material economies and post-capitalist futures. She is currently developing her conceptual interests in three directions. First, she is part of a broader interdisciplinary initiative that develops new materialist approaches to study the relationship between geosciences and geopolitics, building on the resurgent interest in the subsurface across the social sciences. Second, together with Dr Gisa Weszkalnys (LSE), she is developing the concept of 'resource temporalities' which accounts for diverse engagements with time in resource-based economies. Third, Kärg continues to engage with ideas of the performativity of economics in the context of alternative, ostensibly non-capitalist material economies centred on reduced consumption, recycling and degrowth movements.

He applies a mixture of theoretical and empirical methods to investigate various macroecological topics, including species-area relationships and species abundance distributions. In particular, his research has aimed to discern how diversity (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic) is affected by environmental change, with a particular focus on habitat loss and fragmentation and the structure of ecological communities in fragmented landscapes. He has a keen interest in island systems, and in particular the application of island theory to habitat island systems.
His research also aims to provide information of use in biodiversity conservation in fragmented landscapes and island systems, and a number of his papers are focused on conservation biogeography issues. Recently, he has started to focus on the impact of human-driven species extinctions and introductions on island ecosystem functioning and functional diversity.

Professor Sambrook Smith investigates the linkages between river processes and sedimentology at scales ranging from individual pores within a river bed up to km-long bars in large rivers.
The World’s largest rivers suffer from a paucity of knowledge about how they currently function, how they have evolved through time and how they may respond to future environmental changes. This lack of knowledge matters to the millions of people who live and work on their floodplains but also to society more widely as large river deposits from some of the World’s most important water aquifers and the movement of sediment through rivers is key for replenishing downstream deltas to offset sea level rise.  Rivers may also become sinks for emerging pollutants such as microplastics, about which currently very little is known.
As a process-based fluvial sedimentologist, Professor Sambrook Smith has developed river science by blending, field, experimental and numerical methods to generate a new perspective which bridges temporal and spatial scales to provide a holistic framework for understanding both modern and ancient systems. His research generates new, generic and quantitative understanding of how rivers function across these scales. This is facilitated by development of new techniques such as endoscopic particle imaging velocimetry for use in porous media or application of geophysical techniques for fluvial context.

RESEARCH INTERESTS
Humans have significantly altered the global biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and carbon, mainly though industrialization, land use and climate change. These elements play an incredibly strong role in affecting soil health, food security, greenhouse gas emission and ecosystem resilience. My research tackles these complex challenges by blending large scale novel experimental approaches and manipulations (e.g. elevated CO2, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, agricultural best management practices) to answer fundamental questions about changes in process rates, nitrogen and carbon stocks in soils and greenhouse gas emission into air. The outcomes of my research is fundamental for designing soil, land use and ecosystem management strategies, and predicting the future functioning of soils and ecosystems under global change upon which the survival of human kind depends.
The impetus is to advance mechanistic understanding of the response of key biogeochemical functions in soils (e.g. denitrification, N & C mineralization, biological nitrogen fixation, greenhouse gas fluxes and soil enzyme activity) to land-use and global change at catchment scale.
My research is underpinned by the development and application of novel analytical field techniques including stable isotopes and high-resolution sensor technologies to explore novel relationships between nutrient cycling, plant-microbe interaction and environmental conditions. This knowledge supports the development of new conceptual frameworks and feeds into dynamic ecosystems models for a more realistic assessment of the threshold of biogeochemical functional breakdowns under perturbations; and identification of techniques for sustainable utilization of natural resources, ecosystem restoration, food security and protection of environmental quality. My research cut-across the following themes in biogeochemistry:
Greenhouse Gas Fluxes and Global Climate Change: Terrestrial forest and wetland soils in watersheds as well as cultivated soils are significant sinks of atmospheric carbon and play a substantial role in greenhouse gas exchanges with the atmosphere. Local to global scale changes in land use types and management, excessive fertilizer use in agriculture and human-induced changes in the climate have shifted the interactive controls of various biotic and abiotic controls of methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide fluxes with the atmosphere. A detailed understanding of both landscape scale and plot scale controls of C sequestration and greenhouse gas fluxes from soils in sub-tropical, temperate and boreal climates makes part of Dr Ullah’s research for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from natural and semi-natural and agricultural ecosystems. Key biogeochemical processes that responsible for greenhouse gas production and consumption in soils such as denitrification, nitrification, microbial respiration, methanogenesis and methanotrophy are investigated using novel in situ techniques and stable isotopes for fingerprinting the sources and rates of greenhouse gas production. 
Land Use, Soil Fertility, Food Security and Water quality: Agricultural intensification, excessive fertilizer use, rising food demands and urbanization are often associated with nutrient/pollutant loss into surface and groundwater. Loss of nutrients such as mineral and dissolved organic N and phosphorus (P) from croplands and urban land uses cascading from soils into surface and groundwater results in the degradation of water quality such as eutrophication and hypoxia. Given the significance of maintaining food productivity for human consumption, Dr Ullah’s research identifies soil and landscape management practices that reduces loss of nutrients from soil into water and improves nutrient use efficiency in crop production systems.Restoration Ecology: A tremendous loss of natural wetlands in watersheds mainly due to cultivation and urbanization has in turn led to a significant loss in wetland ecosystem functions and services. There is particular interest to restore wetlands in watersheds in a way that could render key functions of wetlands and services such as carbon sequestration and attenuation of pollutant run-off from cultivation and urban environments beside provision of habitat to wildlife, flood control and groundwater recharge. Dr Ullah’s research explores and identifies restoration techniques that could help recover multiple functional attributes of wetlands within the context of enhanced environmental quality.

This knowledge supports the development of new conceptual frameworks and feeds into dynamic ecosystems models for a more realistic assessment of the threshold of biogeochemical functional breakdowns under perturbations; and identification of techniques for sustainable utilization of natural resources, ecosystem restoration, food security and protection of environmental quality. My research cut-across the following themes in biogeochemistry:
Greenhouse Gas Fluxes and Global Climate Change: Terrestrial forest and wetland soils in watersheds as well as cultivated soils are significant sinks of atmospheric carbon and play a substantial role in greenhouse gas exchanges with the atmosphere. Local to global scale changes in land use types and management, excessive fertilizer use in agriculture and human-induced changes in the climate have shifted the interactive controls of various biotic and abiotic controls of methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide fluxes with the atmosphere. A detailed understanding of both landscape scale and plot scale controls of C sequestration and greenhouse gas fluxes from soils in sub-tropical, temperate and boreal climates makes part of Dr Ullah’s research for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from natural and semi-natural and agricultural ecosystems. Key biogeochemical processes that responsible for greenhouse gas production and consumption in soils such as denitrification, nitrification, microbial respiration, methanogenesis and methanotrophy are investigated using novel in situ techniques and stable isotopes for fingerprinting the sources and rates of greenhouse gas production. 
Land Use, Soil Fertility, Food Security and Water quality: Agricultural intensification, excessive fertilizer use, rising food demands and urbanization are often associated with nutrient/pollutant loss into surface and groundwater. Loss of nutrients such as mineral and dissolved organic N and phosphorus (P) from croplands and urban land uses cascading from soils into surface and groundwater results in the degradation of water quality such as eutrophication and hypoxia. Given the significance of maintaining food productivity for human consumption, Dr Ullah’s research identifies soil and landscape management practices that reduces loss of nutrients from soil into water and improves nutrient use efficiency in crop production systems.Restoration Ecology: A tremendous loss of natural wetlands in watersheds mainly due to cultivation and urbanization has in turn led to a significant loss in wetland ecosystem functions and services. There is particular interest to restore wetlands in watersheds in a way that could render key functions of wetlands and services such as carbon sequestration and attenuation of pollutant run-off from cultivation and urban environments beside provision of habitat to wildlife, flood control and groundwater recharge. Dr Ullah’s research explores and identifies restoration techniques that could help recover multiple functional attributes of wetlands within the context of enhanced environmental quality.
